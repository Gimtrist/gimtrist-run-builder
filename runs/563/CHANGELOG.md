# Changelog

## [0.17.2] — 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Score inflation from power-up creation** — `processMatches()` counted bubbles that became power-ups as "popped" (`totalPopped += group.length` ran before filtering), inflating `baseScore` and `sizeBonus` by 10–25+ points per power-up created. With streak/fever multipliers, the over-count cascaded into significantly inflated final scores. Fixed by moving the `totalPopped++` increment inside the pop branch so only actually-destroyed bubbles are counted
- **Render loop running during pause** — `update()` continued rendering power-up overlays, fever meter, and hint glow every frame while paused, wasting GPU cycles behind the opaque pause overlay. Added `isPaused` early-return guard

## [0.17.1] — 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **Storage key constants (`SK`)** — Extracted 30+ scattered `'whatspoppin_*'` magic strings into a centralized `SK` constant object with static keys and dynamic key generators (`SK.BEST_GRADE(mode)`, `SK.DAILY(dateKey)`, `SK.ACHIEVEMENT(id)`). Eliminates silent typo bugs and provides single-source-of-truth for all SafeStorage key names
- **Unified swap-search (`_findValidSwap`)** — `findHintMove()` and `hasPossibleMoves()` contained near-identical 16-line grid traversals with try-swap-check-undo logic. Extracted the shared algorithm into `_findValidSwap()` — `findHintMove()` delegates directly, `hasPossibleMoves()` becomes a one-liner null check. Net ~15 lines removed
- **Grid iteration utility (`forEachCell`)** — Extracted the repeated `for(r) for(c)` nested loop pattern (5 occurrences) into a `forEachCell(callback)` helper. Applied to `renderPowerUpOverlays()` and `reshuffleGrid()` (both collect + assign passes). Remaining grid loops retained where early-return semantics require `for` (swap search)

## [0.17.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Daily Challenge mode** — A new game mode where every player gets the same deterministic grid each day, seeded from the UTC date via a mulberry32 PRNG. Timed at 90 seconds with 3 hint charges, like standard timed mode. Daily best score persists via SafeStorage with date-keyed entries (`whatspoppin_daily_YYYY-MM-DD`). Title screen shows a fire-icon Daily Challenge button with today's date and completion status (✓ + best score when completed). Game over screen displays daily-specific header ("DAILY COMPLETE"), date badge, and lifetime daily completion count. Share card includes the daily date for social comparison. Lifetime daily counter tracks total challenges completed. `VALID_MODES` allowlist updated to include `'daily'` — all security guards (sanitizeMode, scene data validation) accept the new mode

## [0.16.1] — 2026-04-07

### Security
- **SafeStorage checksum bypass fix** — `get()` previously returned raw values when the `_c` checksum key was missing (`if (check && ...)` short-circuited to `false`). Attackers could modify any stored value and delete its companion checksum key to bypass integrity checks entirely. Fixed to `if (!check || check !== ...)` — missing checksums are now treated as tampered
- **SafeStorage key validation** — Added `_validKey()` gate on both `get()` and `set()`. Enforces alphanumeric + underscore pattern with 64-char max. Prevents prototype pollution and storage key injection via crafted inputs
- **SafeStorage value size cap** — `set()` now rejects values exceeding 1KB, preventing localStorage abuse via oversized writes
- **RunHistory JSON hardening** — Added 4KB size cap on raw JSON string before `JSON.parse()` to prevent memory-bomb attacks. Tightened entry validation: enforces `typeof === 'object'` check, non-negative number ranges, grade allowlist (`/^[A-FS]{1,2}$/`), and mode allowlist (`timed`/`zen`) on every deserialized field

## [0.16.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Run history sparkline** — New `src/history.js` module tracks the last 10 game results (score, grade, mode, streak) via SafeStorage with JSON tamper validation. Title screen renders an animated bar chart where each bar represents a game session, color-coded by grade tier (S=gold, A=green, B=blue, C=orange, D=red, F=grey). Bars animate in with staggered `Back.easeOut` timing. The latest bar pulses with a glow effect and shows the score label. A trend arrow (↑/↓/→) compares the most recent score to the rolling average. Replaces the plain high score text once 2+ games are recorded; falls back gracefully for new players

## [0.15.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Colorblind mode** — Eye icon toggle on the title screen enables unique geometric symbols on each bubble color (diamond, cross, ring, triangle, square, 6-point star). Makes the game fully playable for the ~8% of men with color vision deficiency. Symbol textures are generated once at boot alongside the standard bubbles via `CB_SYMBOLS` drawers. All bubble texture references routed through `bubbleKey()` helper for seamless switching. Setting persists across sessions via SafeStorage (`whatspoppin_colorblind`)
- **`Icons.a11y()`** — New eye icon drawn with Phaser Graphics arcs for the colorblind mode toggle

## [0.14.1] — 2026-04-06

### Security
- **COOP/COEP headers** — Added `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` to SW security headers and HTML meta tag. Mitigates Spectre-class cross-origin window reference attacks and enables `crossOriginIsolated` mode
- **Permissions-Policy in SW headers** — SW-served responses now carry `Permissions-Policy` header, reinforcing the HTML meta tag that browsers may not honor in all contexts
- **Cache content-type validation** — SW now validates response `content-type` against a `SAFE_CACHE_TYPES` allowlist before caching. Prevents cache poisoning via unexpected MIME types
- **Grid bounds validation** — `swapBubbles()` now validates all row/col coordinates against `GRID_ROWS`/`GRID_COLS` before array access, preventing OOB access from tampered Phaser data stores

### Added
- **16 security tests** — `safety.test.js` covers COOP/COEP headers, Permissions-Policy, cache content-type validation, SRI integrity, COOP meta tag, grid bounds guards, recursion cap, and VALID_MODES allowlist

## [0.14.0] — 2026-04-05

### Changed
- **Extract `createMuteToggle()` shared utility** — The duplicated mute-icon-swap closures (`drawMuteBtn` in TitleScene, `drawMuteIcon` in GameScene) are now a single factory function with configurable color, size, and depth. Both scenes delegate to it, eliminating ~20 lines of repeated destroy-recreate-toggle logic and ensuring mute button behavior stays consistent across all scenes
- **TipsScene back button uses `createButton` factory** — Replaced 12 lines of hand-rolled button code (manual graphics bg, text, and hit zone) with the existing `createButton()` factory that every other scene already uses. Gains hover feedback for free and stays visually consistent with the rest of the UI

## [0.13.3] — 2026-04-04

### Security
- **`gameMode` allowlist validation** — Scene data `mode` is now validated against a frozen allowlist (`Set(['timed', 'zen'])`) before use. Previously, `data.mode` from Phaser scene transitions was interpolated directly into localStorage key names (`whatspoppin_games_${this.gameMode}`), allowing devtools or tampered scene data to write arbitrary storage keys. Defense-in-depth validation also added to `GameOverScene`
- **`processMatches` recursion depth cap** — Cascade chain recursion is now capped at 20 levels (`MAX_CHAIN_DEPTH`). Previously, a degenerate grid state (e.g. via memory manipulation) could trigger unbounded recursive `processMatches()` → `dropBubbles()` → `refillGrid()` → `findAllMatches()` → `processMatches()` chains, eventually causing a stack overflow and crashing the browser tab

## [0.13.2] — 2026-04-04

### Changed
- **`GameScene.update()` decomposition** — Extracted the monolithic 105-line `update()` method into three focused render subsystems: `renderPowerUpOverlays(time)`, `renderFeverMeter(time)`, and `renderHintGlow(time)`. Each method owns a single visual concern with its own JSDoc, early-return guard, and reduced nesting depth. The fever bar color selection was also simplified from a mutable 5-branch if/else chain to a declarative ternary. Zero behavioral change — purely structural improvement for maintainability

## [0.13.1] — 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **`shareScore` variable shadowing** — Renamed local `safeScore` variable to `cleanScore` to avoid shadowing the module-level `safeScore()` function, preventing silent breakage if the function is called later in the same scope
- **Unguarded stat column division** — Replaced raw `1 / (statItems.length + 1)` with `safeDiv()` for consistent defensive arithmetic in the game-over stats layout
- **Streak multiplier floor** — Added `Math.max(1, ...)` and `Number.isFinite()` guard to `streakMultiplier` so corrupted/NaN streak values can never zero-multiply earned points away silently

## [0.13.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Cascade Chain Counter** — Gravity-induced chain reactions now display a graffiti-style "CHAIN ×N" banner at screen center with glitch text effect (offset shadow duplicate), spring-scale entrance, and fade-out. Color escalates with depth: cyan (×2) → gold (×3) → magenta (×4+). Deep chains (×3+) trigger extra camera shake for impact
- **Chain score bonus** — Each cascade level adds +25 points to the base score before multipliers. A ×3 chain during a ×5 streak earns an extra 250 points. Bonus indicator text appears below the chain banner
- **Chain stats in game over** — "BEST CHAIN" column appears in the end-game stats row when the player achieved a ×2+ chain. Also included in the share card text
- **7 new tests** — Chain bonus scoring: depth 1 (no bonus), depth 2/3 (additive), streak scaling, power-up stacking, size bonus stacking, deep chain with full multipliers

## [0.12.1] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Comprehensive JSDoc for `processMatches()`** — The core game loop orchestrator now has full documentation: 8-stage pipeline table (power-up detection → pop → activate → create → fever → scoring → milestones/achievements → gravity cascade), recursion model explanation, scoring formula breakdown, parameter/return annotations, and cross-references to `findAllMatches`, `PowerUpSystem.analyze`, `safeScore`, and `Achievements.check`
- **README: Match Processing Pipeline section** — New architecture section with ASCII pipeline diagram, recursion model, and scoring formula. Architecture tree updated to reference `processMatches()`

## [0.12.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Fever Mode** — Combo energy meter that fills with consecutive matches and triggers a 2× score bonus state. Left-edge vertical bar with 4 color stages (blue → green → yellow → red → gold). At 100% fill, FEVER MODE activates for 6 seconds with dramatic banner announcement, pulsing gold border, and enhanced star-burst particles. Matching during fever extends the timer by 1.5s (max 10s). Meter drains slowly during idle moments to maintain tension. Score popup shows 🔥 indicator during fever. Fever count displayed in game over stats and share card. Tips scene updated with Fever Mode strategy section

## [0.11.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Achievement system** — 8 progression milestones that unlock during gameplay: FIRST BLOOD (first pop), ON FIRE (5× streak), DEMON TIME (8× streak), TRANSCENDENT (12× streak), BIG MONEY (5,000+ score), UNTOUCHABLE (10,000+ score), POP MACHINE (500 lifetime pops), DEDICATED (10 games played). Each achievement fires a slide-in toast notification with star icon, tier-colored card, and a satisfying two-tone unlock sound (ascending triangle waves). Multiple unlocks in one match stagger automatically. Achievement progress is shown in the Your Legacy dashboard with a 2-column grid layout, color-coded dot indicators, and unlock/lock states. All achievements persist via SafeStorage with `whatspoppin_ach_<id>` keys. Session + lifetime stats are checked both during gameplay (processMatches) and at game end (endGame) to catch every unlock path

## [0.10.4] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **32 new unit tests across 3 untested critical paths** — New `core.test.js` covering: `scanRuns` (10 tests: horizontal/vertical 3-match detection, end-of-row matches, null hole handling, two separate matches in one row, single-cell edge case, full-row match), `textStyle`/`TEXT_PRESETS` (5 tests: immutability, override merging without mutation, unknown preset error, fontFamily invariant, preset completeness), and `SafeStorage` (17 tests: round-trip string/int, tamper detection, cross-key replay attack prevention, scientific/hex/float/negative/overflow rejection in getInt, checksum determinism and key-binding, salt caching and format validation). Total test count: 149 passing

## [0.10.3] — 2026-03-30

### Changed
- **Text style preset system (`TEXT_PRESETS` + `textStyle()`)** — Extracted 8 named typography presets (heading, stat, label, muted, accent, body, popup, badge) and a composable `textStyle(preset, overrides)` factory function. Replaced ~30 inline style objects across all 7 scenes, eliminating repetitive `fontFamily: UI_FONT` / `fontStyle: 'bold'` / `stroke: '#000000'` boilerplate at every `this.add.text()` call site. Each text element now declares its visual intent by name instead of re-specifying 3-6 raw properties. Net reduction of 75 lines with zero visual change. Typography changes (font, stroke weight, color palette) now update from a single location instead of hunting across 54 scattered call sites

## [0.10.2] — 2026-03-30

### Changed
- **Character drawing: extract `drawEye()` and `drawShadow()` helpers** — Consolidated ~70 lines of duplicated eye-drawing code (sclera → iris → pupil → highlight) across all 4 characters (Kira, Blaze, Ronin, Empress) into a single parameterized `drawEye()` function. Each character's eye personality (Kira's dark almond eyes, Blaze's fierce orange, Ronin's narrow red slits, Empress's piercing purple with sub-glow) is now expressed as a compact config object instead of 16-20 raw lines. Also extracted `drawShadow()` for the 4 identical ground-shadow ellipses. Net reduction of ~55 lines with zero visual change

## [0.10.1] — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Division-by-zero and NaN guard hardening** — Added `safeDiv()` utility to centralise defensive division across scoring and stats display (avg-per-move, avg-per-game). Added `safeScore()` to clamp score accumulation in `processMatches`, preventing NaN/Infinity propagation through the scoring pipeline. Upgraded `endGame` scene hand-off from weak `|| 0` fallbacks to `safeScore()` (catches Infinity, which `|| 0` misses). All 5 division sites now route through the same guard
- **13 new unit tests** — `safeDiv` (zero, NaN, Infinity, negative, overflow) and `safeScore` (NaN, Infinity, negative, undefined, custom max). Total: 117 tests

## [0.10.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Streak multiplier badge** — A prominent animated HUD element that makes the scoring multiplier visible during active streaks. Appears as a floating badge centered above the score bar showing ×2 through ×10. The ring grows with multiplier level, changes color to match streak tier (green → gold → red → purple), bounces in on first appearance, punches on each increment, and pulses with a breathing glow at ×8+. Fades out smoothly when the streak breaks. The multiplier was always in the scoring formula but completely invisible to players — now they can see exactly why streaks matter
- **5 new unit tests** — Multiplier badge visibility thresholds, cap at ×10, parity with scoring formula, tier color escalation. Total: 104 tests

## [0.9.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Live milestone notifications** — "NEW HIGH SCORE!" and "BEST STREAK: Nx" banners fire instantly mid-game the moment you surpass a personal record. Gold horizontal glow band with scale-in text and sparkle burst for high scores; red variant for best streaks. Each milestone fires only once per game. First-ever games (no stored records) stay clean — no false celebrations. When both milestones trigger on the same match, the streak banner staggers 1.8s to avoid overlap
- **8 new unit tests** — Milestone detection logic: fire-once semantics, no-record guard, simultaneous dual-fire, equality edge cases, first-game suppression. Total: 99 tests

## [0.8.1] — 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **HUD toolbar: extract `createToolbarBtn()` helper** — Consolidated 3 identical toolbar button creation blocks (pause, hint, mute) in GameScene into a single `createToolbarBtn()` factory function. Each button previously duplicated 8 lines of Graphics fill/stroke, depth assignment, and hit-zone wiring. The factory handles bg rendering, icon placement, and interactive hit-zone setup in one call, returning refs for downstream use. Net reduction of ~20 lines with zero behavioral change

## [0.8.0] — 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Lifetime Stats Dashboard ("Your Legacy")** — New StatsScene accessible from the title screen via a trophy-adorned button. Displays lifetime statistics with animated count-up values and color-coded progress bars: total games played (with timed/zen split), all-time high score, cumulative score, total bubbles popped (with per-game averages), and best streak ever achieved
- **Persistent stat tracking** — Every completed game now records lifetime counters in SafeStorage: games per mode, total bubbles popped, cumulative score, and all-time best streak. All values are checksum-protected and tamper-resistant
- **Best grade showcase** — Stats dashboard displays best letter grades earned per mode with dramatic scale-in reveal animations. Streak-tier character appears in the header when a streak milestone has been reached
- **Trophy icon** — New `Icons.trophy()` procedurally drawn icon for the stats button

## [0.7.1] — 2026-03-26

### Security
- **SafeStorage: keyed checksums with per-install salt** — `_checksum()` now binds the storage key name and a per-install cryptographic salt into the FNV-1a digest. Previously the checksum only hashed the raw value, allowing cross-key replay attacks (copy a valid value+checksum between keys) and pre-computed cheat scripts that work on every installation. The salt is generated via `crypto.getRandomValues()` and stored under an opaque key
- **SafeStorage: strict integer validation** — `getInt()` now rejects scientific notation (`1e10`), hex (`0xff`), and float strings (`3.14`) via `/^\d{1,10}$/` allowlist. Previously `parseInt(raw, 10)` would silently accept these formats, allowing crafted values to bypass range expectations

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-25

### Changed
- **AudioEngine: extract `_tone()` helper** — Consolidated 15+ duplicated oscillator+gain+envelope boilerplate blocks across `playSelect`, `playPop`, `playInvalid`, `playLand`, `playNice`, `playFire`, `playGodlike`, `playLegendary`, `bgKick`, `bgSnare`, and `bgBass` into a single `_tone(t, opts)` method. Supports frequency sweeps, attack envelopes, and background node tracking. Net reduction of ~147 lines with zero behavioral change. Sound methods now read as declarative voice descriptions instead of low-level Web Audio wiring

## [0.6.1] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Hint & Auto-Select deep-dive in README** — New dedicated section documenting the dual-trigger hint system (manual lightbulb + 5s idle auto-select), `findHintMove()` algorithm, charge economy, visual feedback (gold pulsing glow with sine-wave animation), and a state machine diagram showing IDLE → AUTO_HINT / MANUAL_HINT transitions

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Performance grade system** — Every game ends with a letter grade (S/A/B/C/D/F) based on score and best streak combined. S-grade requires 5000+ score AND 8+ streak — high score alone isn't enough, you need to chain. Grade reveals with a dramatic scale-in animation after the score counts up
- **S-grade visual flair** — Achieving S-grade triggers a pulsing gold glow ring and breathing scale animation on the grade letter, making it screenshot-worthy
- **Per-mode best grade persistence** — Best grade earned is stored separately for Timed and Zen modes via SafeStorage. Displayed as compact badges on the title screen below the high score
- **Grade in share card** — Score sharing now includes your grade and its label (e.g., "Grade: S — SUPREME"), adding social bragging rights
- **Compact character display on Game Over** — Streak-tier character now renders as a small badge beside the grade instead of a large hero element, keeping the layout clean
- **9 new unit tests** — Grade threshold logic, streak/score interaction, rank monotonicity, edge cases (high score + low streak, low score + high streak). Total: 91 tests

## [0.5.2] — 2026-03-23

### Security
- **CSP: add `object-src 'none'`** — Blocks plugin/object loading (Flash, Java applets) from same origin. Previously relied on `default-src 'self'` fallback which was too permissive
- **CSP: add `upgrade-insecure-requests`** — Forces HTTPS for all subresource loads. README documented this directive but it was missing from both `index.html` and `sw.js`
- **Add `X-Frame-Options: DENY`** — Clickjacking protection for legacy browsers that don't support CSP `frame-ancestors`. Added as both HTML meta tag and SW response header
- **SW: harden all cached responses** — Previously, only the offline fallback and 503 error responses received security headers. Cached responses from `caches.match()` were returned raw without CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options`, or `Referrer-Policy`. Now every same-origin response served through the SW gets the full security header set via `hardenResponse()`. Cross-origin (opaque) CDN responses are exempt to preserve SRI verification
- **SW: add `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`** — Injected on all SW-served responses, matching the `<meta>` tag in `index.html`
- **SW cache version bump** — `whatspoppin-v4` → `whatspoppin-v5` to force existing installations to pick up the hardened SW

## [0.5.1] — 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Game Over crash** — `GameOverScene.create()` crashed with `TypeError` when receiving undefined data (e.g. scene restart without params, race condition during transition). Destructuring now falls back to safe defaults
- **Share score crash** — `shareScore()` called `.toLocaleString()` on potentially undefined values; now validates all numeric inputs before formatting
- **High score NaN guard** — `endGame()` validates `this.score` is finite before comparing/writing to SafeStorage, preventing NaN from corrupting the stored high score
- **Scene hand-off hardening** — `endGame()` defensively coerces all values passed to GameOverScene, closing the gap between GameScene (which already guarded `data?.mode`) and GameOverScene (which didn't)

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Sound toggle** — persistent mute/unmute button on both the title screen and in-game HUD (left of hint button). Uses `AudioEngine.toggleMute()` to zero/restore master gain. Mute preference stored in SafeStorage, restored across sessions via `restoreMuteState()`
- **Score sharing** — "SHARE SCORE" button on the Game Over screen generates a formatted text score card with final score, best streak (with tier label), moves, avg/move, and game mode. Uses Web Share API on mobile, falls back to Clipboard API on desktop. Animated toast notification confirms the action
- **3 new procedural icons** — `Icons.sound()` (speaker with sound waves), `Icons.soundOff()` (speaker with red X), `Icons.share()` (upload/export arrow with box)
- **Game mode passthrough** — Game Over screen now receives the current game mode and "PLAY AGAIN" restarts in the same mode (was hardcoded to timed)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Hint system** — tap the lightbulb button (top-right, beside pause) to reveal a valid swap with pulsing gold rings and a directional guide line
- **Auto-hint on idle** — after 5 seconds of inactivity, a hint appears automatically to keep players moving (the "auto-select" feature)
- **Hint economy** — timed mode gives 3 hints (displayed as a counter badge); zen mode has unlimited hints
- **Lightbulb icon** — new `Icons.hint()` procedural icon with radiating rays
- Hint visualization renders in the game loop (`update()`) with smooth sine-wave pulsing — outer glow ring + inner ring + connecting guide line between the two swap targets
- Hints auto-clear on any player interaction (tap, swipe, or swap)

## [0.3.4] — 2026-03-21

### Changed
- Added JSDoc documentation to `PowerUpSystem` class — `analyze()`, `isLOrTShape()`, `getAffectedCells()` now have full param/return docs and behavioral descriptions
- Added JSDoc documentation to `PowerUpRenderer.draw()` with parameter descriptions
- Added JSDoc block to `POWERUP_TYPES` enum explaining each type and its match pattern trigger
- Added comprehensive JSDoc to `SafeStorage` in `init.js` — block-level usage example, method docs for `get()`, `getInt()`, `set()`, and `_checksum()`
- Expanded `drawDarkGridBg()` JSDoc with return type and visual description
- Updated README: added Architecture section documenting file roles and load order, added `npm run dev` command, confirmed test count (82), added `npm run dev` command, documented race condition guards in Security section

## [0.3.3] — 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Extracted `getStreakLevel(streak)` helper replacing 4 duplicated `STREAK_LEVELS.filter().pop()` chains across `showScorePopup`, `updateStreakUI`, `triggerHypeBar`, and `GameOverScene`
- Extracted `getAdlibTier(streak)` helper replacing inline `Math.max(...Object.keys().map().filter())` expression — clearer intent, no intermediate array allocations
- Extracted `scanRuns()` direction-agnostic line scanner replacing duplicated horizontal and vertical match-detection loops in `findAllMatches()` — single implementation, two axis calls
- Net reduction of ~20 lines while improving readability and extensibility

## [0.3.2] — 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Extracted unified `createButton()` factory replacing 3 duplicated button methods across TitleScene, GameOverScene, and GameScene — single source of truth for button rendering, hover states, and hit zones
- Extracted `drawDarkGridBg()` utility replacing duplicated dark grid background drawing in TitleScene and GameScene
- Extracted `UI_FONT` constant replacing 40+ hardcoded `'"Segoe UI", system-ui, sans-serif'` strings — font changes are now a one-liner
- Net reduction of ~30 lines while improving maintainability

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-18

### Security
- Fixed CSP gap in service worker: offline fallback responses now carry full `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` headers — previously had zero CSP protection
- Added missing CSP directives `base-uri 'self'`, `form-action 'self'`, and `frame-ancestors 'none'` to both `index.html` meta tag and SW synthesized responses — closes base-tag injection, form hijack, and clickjacking vectors
- Bumped service worker cache to `whatspoppin-v4` to invalidate stale caches
- Offline fallback page now renders a styled, branded page instead of raw unstyled HTML

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-18

### Security
- Removed `'unsafe-inline'` from CSP `script-src` — inline scripts extracted to `src/init.js`, closing primary XSS vector
- Added `Permissions-Policy` header disabling camera, microphone, geolocation, payment, USB, and sensor APIs
- Added `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` to prevent information leakage to third-party CDN
- Wrapped all localStorage operations in `SafeStorage` with try-catch — prevents crashes in private browsing or when storage is disabled/full
- Added FNV-1a checksum validation on stored values (high score, played flag) — detects casual localStorage tampering
- Hardened service worker fetch: validates response origins before caching, returns graceful offline fallback on network failure instead of unhandled rejection
- Bumped service worker cache to `whatspoppin-v3` to invalidate stale caches
- Scoped service worker registration to `'/'`

## [0.2.3] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- 20 new tests for critical untested paths: deadlock detection (`hasPossibleMoves`), advanced match patterns (cross-shaped, parallel, boundary, full-board, sub-minimum), gravity edge cases (alternating gaps, empty columns, multi-gap row data), BOMB/LINE edge positions (middle-edge clipping, sparse rows/columns), and scoring boundary conditions
- Total test count: 82 (up from 62)

## [0.2.2] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- 28 new tests covering untested critical paths: match-finding algorithm (horizontal, vertical, L-shaped grouping, null gaps, long runs), adjacency validation (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, same-cell, distance-2), grid swap primitive (data consistency, double-swap idempotency, null handling), streak tier resolution (all thresholds and between-tier behavior), adlib tier selection (tier boundaries and edge case), and gravity/drop simulation (gap filling, multi-drop stacking, full-column no-op)
- Total test count: 62 (up from 34)

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- 34 unit tests with Vitest covering critical game logic: power-up analysis, L/T shape detection, area-of-effect cell calculations, scoring formula, edge cases (grid corners, null cells, unknown types), and game constant integrity
- `npm test` now runs the test suite (was previously a no-op)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-17

### Security
- Added Subresource Integrity (SRI) hash for CDN-loaded Phaser script — prevents supply chain attacks
- Added Content-Security-Policy meta tag restricting script/style/connect sources
- Hardened localStorage reads with explicit radix and NaN guards on `parseInt`
- Sanitized score writes to prevent storing non-numeric values

### Fixed
- Service worker now caches the actual CDN URL for Phaser instead of a non-existent `node_modules/` path — offline play actually works now
- Bumped service worker cache version to `whatspoppin-v2` to invalidate stale caches

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- Lifetime stats scene with persistent progress tracking

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-16
