# What's Poppin

Bubble pop game with cultural sauce. Match bubbles, build streaks, unleash characters.

## Features

- **Core gameplay** — Swap adjacent bubbles, match 3+ to pop, chain cascades. Cascade chains (gravity-induced matches) display a glitch-style "CHAIN ×N" banner with escalating colors (cyan → gold → magenta) and earn bonus points
- **Power-ups** — Match 4 (Line Clear), Match 5+ (Bomb), L/T shape (Color Nuke)
- **Streak system** — Chain matches for multipliers (×2–×10), unlock characters at 3x/5x/8x/12x. Live multiplier badge shows your current bonus mid-game with tier-colored ring, bounce-in animation, and pulsing glow at ×8+
- **4 characters** — Kira, Blaze, Ronin, Empress — each with unique vibes
- **Synthesized audio** — Lo-fi beat, melodic pops, 808 bass hits, streak SFX (Web Audio API). Internal `_tone()` helper makes adding new sounds trivial
- **Hint system** — Tap the lightbulb to reveal a valid move; auto-hints after 5s idle (resets on interaction or after hint fires). 3 charges in timed, unlimited in zen. Hints safely clear if referenced bubbles are destroyed by cascades (see [Hint & Auto-Select System](#hint--auto-select-system) below)
- **Sound toggle** — Mute/unmute from title screen or in-game HUD via shared `createMuteToggle()` factory. Preference persists across sessions via SafeStorage
- **Performance grades** — Earn S/A/B/C/D/F grades based on score + streak combo. S-grade requires 5000+ score AND 8+ streak — dramatic reveal animation with pulsing glow. Best grade persists per mode, included in share card
- **Fever Mode** — Chain matches to fill the left-edge meter. At 100%, FEVER MODE activates with 2× score multiplier, pulsing gold border, and enhanced star-burst particles. Keep matching during fever to extend the timer (up to 10s). The meter drains during idle moments — stay aggressive. Fever count shown in game over stats and share card
- **Live milestones** — "NEW HIGH SCORE!" and "BEST STREAK!" banners fire instantly mid-game when you beat your personal records. Gold/red glow band, scale-in text, and sparkle burst. Each fires once per game; first-ever games (no records to beat) stay clean
- **Score sharing** — Copy your score card to clipboard or share via Web Share API on mobile. Formatted for social posting
- **Lifetime stats** — "Your Legacy" dashboard tracks all-time games played (per mode), total bubbles popped, cumulative score, best streak, and best grades. Animated count-up values and color-coded progress bars. All stats checksum-protected via SafeStorage
- **Achievements** — 8 progression milestones (FIRST BLOOD, ON FIRE, DEMON TIME, TRANSCENDENT, BIG MONEY, UNTOUCHABLE, POP MACHINE, DEDICATED) that unlock during gameplay with animated toast notifications and a satisfying two-tone unlock sound. Achievement progress is displayed in the Your Legacy dashboard with color-coded unlock indicators. Persisted via SafeStorage
- **Colorblind mode** — Toggle from the title screen to add unique geometric symbols (diamond, cross, ring, triangle, square, star) to each bubble color. Makes the game fully playable for players with color vision deficiency. Persists across sessions via SafeStorage
- **Run history sparkline** — Title screen displays an animated bar chart of your last 10 game scores, color-coded by grade tier (S=gold, A=green, B=blue, C=orange, D=red). Latest bar pulses with a glow effect and shows the score. A trend arrow (↑/↓/→) compares your last game to the rolling average. Replaces the plain high score display once you have 2+ games. History persisted via SafeStorage with tamper validation
- **Daily Challenge** — A new daily puzzle where every player gets the same deterministic grid, seeded from the UTC date via mulberry32 PRNG. Timed at 90s with 3 hints. Best score persists per day; title screen shows completion status and your daily best. Game over screen displays daily-specific branding with lifetime completion count. Share card includes the date for social comparison
- **Three modes** — Timed (90s), Zen (no timer), and Daily Challenge (seeded daily grid)
- **Tutorial** — Interactive walkthrough for new players
- **PWA** — Installable, offline-capable, mobile-optimized

## Architecture

```
src/
  init.js        — SafeStorage (keyed checksums + per-install salt) + SW registration
  history.js     — RunHistory persistence (last 10 games) + drawRunSparkline() animated bar chart renderer
  game.js        — Grid engine, 7 Phaser scenes (incl. StatsScene), processMatches() pipeline (see below, depth-capped at 20), hint system, fever meter, colorblind mode (CB_SYMBOLS + bubbleKey()), TEXT_PRESETS + textStyle() typography system, achievement system (ACHIEVEMENTS + Achievements helper), DailyChallenge system (mulberry32 seeded PRNG + date-keyed persistence), VALID_MODES allowlist for scene data sanitization, SK storage key constants (centralized SafeStorage key registry), forEachCell() grid iteration utility, _findValidSwap() unified swap-search (shared by hints + possible-move checks), per-frame render subsystems (renderPowerUpOverlays, renderFeverMeter, renderHintGlow), shared helpers (scanRuns, createButton, createToolbarBtn, createMuteToggle, safeDiv, safeScore, etc.)
  safety.test.js — Safety & security tests: COOP/COEP headers, cache content-type validation, SRI, grid bounds guards, recursion caps, object freeze verification, scoring integrity (totalPopped accuracy), pause-state render guard
  powerups.js    — PowerUpSystem (match analysis) + PowerUpRenderer (animated overlays)
  audio.js       — AudioEngine — fully synthesized sound via Web Audio API, _tone() helper, persistent mute toggle
  characters.js  — Procedurally drawn characters (Phaser Graphics API) + shared drawEye()/drawShadow() helpers
  icons.js       — Icons class — SVG-style icon system (sound, soundOff, share, hint, trophy, a11y, etc.)
  game.test.js   — unit tests (power-ups, scoring, chain bonus, matching, gravity, milestones, badges, safeDiv/safeScore, swap-reversal invariant, hint render safety)
  core.test.js   — unit tests (scanRuns, textStyle/TEXT_PRESETS, SafeStorage tamper detection)
  sw.test.js     — service worker tests (CSP policy constants, ASSETS manifest, hardenResponse, offline fallback, cache versioning)
sw.js            — Service worker with CSP header injection + offline fallback
index.html       — Entry point with CSP meta tag + SRI-verified CDN script
```

All source files attach their exports to `window` — no bundler, no module system. Load order matters: `init.js` → `history.js` → `icons.js` → `powerups.js` → `characters.js` → `audio.js` → `game.js`.

## Security

- **SRI** — CDN scripts verified with SHA-384 subresource integrity hashes
- **CSP** — Content-Security-Policy with no `unsafe-inline` on scripts, `object-src 'none'`, `upgrade-insecure-requests`, `base-uri`/`form-action`/`frame-ancestors` lockdown
- **X-Frame-Options** — `DENY` header on both the HTML meta tag and all SW-served responses for legacy browser clickjacking protection
- **SW header hardening** — Every response served through the SW (cached, network, and offline fallback) gets security headers injected: `CSP`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`, `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`. Cross-origin (opaque) CDN responses are exempt to preserve SRI integrity
- **Cache poisoning guard** — SW only caches responses with safe MIME types via `SAFE_CACHE_TYPES` allowlist (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, images, fonts, WASM). Responses with missing or unexpected content-types are served but never persisted, preventing cache poisoning attacks
- **COOP/COEP** — `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` + `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` mitigate Spectre-class cross-origin attacks and enable `crossOriginIsolated` mode. Set in both SW headers and HTML meta tag
- **Permissions-Policy** — Disables camera, microphone, geolocation, payment, USB via both HTML meta tag and SW response headers
- **Grid bounds validation** — `swapBubbles()` validates all row/col coordinates against grid dimensions before array access, preventing OOB access from tampered Phaser data stores
- **Referrer-Policy** — `no-referrer` prevents information leakage to CDN/third parties
- **SafeStorage** — Try-catch wrappers and FNV-1a keyed checksums with per-install salt. Key validation enforces alphanumeric+underscore pattern and 64-char max on all `get()`/`set()` calls. Value writes capped at 1KB to prevent storage abuse. Missing checksums are treated as tampered (no deletion bypass). All numeric reads via `getInt()` reject scientific notation/hex/floats — only plain decimal digits accepted. Salt integrity is self-guarded — tampering invalidates all stored data
- **Input sanitization layer** — Dedicated `sanitizeMode()`, `sanitizeGrade()`, and `sanitizeStorageKey()` functions validate all user-influenced data at trust boundaries. `sanitizeMode()` whitelists `timed`/`zen` with case-insensitive matching; `sanitizeGrade()` whitelists `S`–`F`; `sanitizeStorageKey()` enforces alphanumeric+underscore with 64-char max. Applied at every scene transition and storage read/display point
- **Score integrity** — High scores validated against checksums to detect tampering; NaN/undefined guards on all score paths prevent corrupted writes. Streak sanitised at `processMatches()` entry to prevent NaN propagation through camera shake, multiplier badge, and hype bar. Streak multiplier floored at 1 to prevent zero-multiplication from corrupted state. Timer bar clamped to [0, 1]. All arithmetic divisions routed through `safeDiv()` for consistent defence
- **Scene data hardening** — GameOverScene validates all incoming data with `Number.isFinite` fallbacks, preventing crashes on undefined game state
- **SW hardening** — Service worker validates response origins, rejects non-HTTP(S) schemes, calls `clients.claim()` on activate for immediate security header coverage on all open tabs, handles network failures gracefully
- **DNS prefetch control** — Disabled to prevent DNS info leakage to third parties
- **PWA scope restriction** — Manifest `scope` locks installed PWA to `/`, preventing navigation outside the app boundary
- **Race condition guards** — `gameOverRef` prevents input after time-up; `transitioningRef` prevents double-fire on simultaneous timer/completion events
- **RunHistory hardening** — JSON string size capped at 4KB before `JSON.parse()` to prevent memory-bomb attacks. Entry validation enforces type checks, non-negative ranges, grade allowlist (`/^[A-FS]{1,2}$/`), and mode allowlist (`timed`/`zen`/`daily`) on every field
- **Object immutability** — Critical security objects (`SafeStorage`, `RunHistory`, `SK`) are frozen via `Object.freeze()` before exposure on `window`, preventing runtime monkey-patching by injected scripts or browser extensions

## Hint & Auto-Select System

The hint system lives in `src/game.js` on `GameScene` and has two trigger paths:

### Manual Hints (Lightbulb Button)

Tapping the lightbulb icon calls `triggerHint()`. In **Timed mode** each tap costs one of 3 hint charges (displayed as a counter badge). In **Zen mode** hints are unlimited (badge shows `∞`). When charges run out, the counter flashes red and the tap is ignored.

### Auto-Hints (Idle Detection)

A 500ms polling timer tracks `idleTime` — milliseconds since the player's last pointer interaction. When `idleTime` reaches **5 000ms** (5 seconds), `showAutoHint()` fires automatically. Auto-hints are always free and never consume charges.

Any pointer down or bubble swap resets `idleTime` to 0 and clears the active hint, so the system stays out of the way during active play.

### How Moves Are Found

`findHintMove()` scans every cell in the grid, trying each adjacent swap (right, then down). For each candidate swap it:

1. Performs the swap on the data grid (`swapGridData`)
2. Runs `findAllMatches()` to check for 3+ runs
3. Reverses the swap immediately
4. Returns the first pair `{ a: {r, c}, b: {r, c} }` that produces a match, or `null` if the board is deadlocked

Worst case is **O(rows × cols)** — fast enough for the 8×8 grid that it runs inside a 500ms timer callback with no perceptible delay.

### Visual Feedback

When a hint is active, the `update()` loop draws animated rings around the two target bubbles:

- **Gold pulsing glow** — Sine-wave oscillation (`0.5 + 0.5 * sin(time * 0.004)`) drives both opacity (0.3–0.8) and ring radius, creating a breathing effect
- **Connecting line** — A dashed gold line links the two hint bubbles so the swap direction is obvious
- Rings clear instantly on the next pointer interaction via `clearHint()`

### State Machine

```
IDLE ──(5s no input)──▶ AUTO_HINT ──(pointer down)──▶ IDLE
  │                                                      │
  └──(tap lightbulb)──▶ MANUAL_HINT ──(pointer down)──▶ IDLE
                            │
                      (charges == 0) → flash red, ignore
```

Key flags: `hintActive` (bool), `hintPair` (cell coords or null), `idleTime` (ms counter), `hintsUsed` / `maxHints` (charge economy).

## Match Processing Pipeline (`processMatches`)

The heart of the game engine. Every match — whether player-initiated or cascade-triggered — flows through `GameScene.processMatches()`, an 8-stage pipeline that orchestrates power-ups, scoring, fever, achievements, and gravity in a single recursive loop.

```
matchGroups (from findAllMatches)
  │
  ├─ 1. Power-up detection ─── PowerUpSystem.analyze() per group
  ├─ 2. Pop & destroy ──────── remove bubbles, play melodic SFX
  ├─ 3. Power-up activate ──── detonate existing power-ups (LINE/BOMB/NUKE)
  ├─ 4. Power-up create ────── transform center bubble → new power-up
  ├─ 5. Fever meter fill ───── +8% base, +3%/streak, +5%/power-up
  ├─ 6. Scoring ────────────── (base + sizeBonus + puBonus) × streak × fever
  ├─ 7. Milestones & Achs ──── live banners + 8-milestone achievement check
  └─ 8. Gravity cascade ────── drop → refill → scan → recurse if matches found
                                  └─ 300ms ─ 350ms ─ 400ms (staggered for animation)
```

**Recursion model:** Stage 8 calls `findAllMatches()` after gravity settles. If new matches exist, `processMatches()` recurses — incrementing `this.streak` each level, which naturally escalates multipliers, camera shake intensity, and visual effects. Input stays locked (`isProcessing = true`) across the entire cascade depth.

**Scoring formula:** `safeScore((popped×10 + max(0, popped-4)×15 + activatedPUs×50) × min(streak, 10) × (fever ? 2 : 1))`

All score accumulation passes through `safeScore()` to prevent NaN/Infinity from corrupting the running total — a guard added after [0.10.1] to harden the scoring pipeline.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Four Vitest suites, run by `npm test`, cover live milestone detection (fire-once semantics, no-record guard, simultaneous milestones), performance grade system (threshold logic, rank monotonicity, streak/score interaction), deadlock detection, match-finding algorithm (including cross-shaped and boundary patterns), grid gravity/drop simulation (alternating gaps, empty columns), adjacency validation, swap primitives, streak tier resolution, adlib tier selection, power-up analysis, area-of-effect calculations (edge positions, sparse grids), scoring formula (boundary conditions), shape detection, and game constant integrity.

## Tech Stack

- **Phaser 3** — Game engine (loaded from jsDelivr CDN with SRI)
- **Web Audio API** — All sound synthesized, zero external files
- **Vanilla JS** — No build step, no framework. Shared utilities (`createButton`, `drawDarkGridBg`, `UI_FONT`, `getStreakLevel`, `getAdlibTier`, `scanRuns`) keep scene and game logic DRY
- **Vitest** — Unit testing (dev dependency)
