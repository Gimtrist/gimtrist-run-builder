# XUUnity Light Unity MCP Install Retro Report

## 1. Issue Title
**Successful End-to-End Installation, Verification, and Android Compilation of XUUnity MCP**

## 2. Executive Summary
The installation and verification of XUUnity Light Unity MCP (`v0.3.21`) in a consumer Unity project completed successfully. The project was prepared offline, verified online via TCP loopback transport, and subjected to EditMode test execution and batch compilation for the Android build target. All operations completed cleanly without issues.

## 3. Environment Table
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **OS** | macOS (Macbook) |
| **Shell** | zsh |
| **Python Version** | 3.13.2 |
| **Unity Version** | 6000.3.3f1 |
| **MCP Client Name** | CLI Tool (Antigravity Agent) |
| **XUUnity MCP Version** | v0.3.21 |

## 4. Project Topology
- **Workspace Layout**: Single-project repository
- **Project Path**: `<workspace>/<UnityProject>`
- **Unity version**: `6000.3.3f1` (Unity 6)

## 5. Installation Route Attempted
- **README Git UPM installation** merged with the automated helper `setup-plan` / `setup-apply` flow.
- **Host Helper Initialization** via `init_xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh` to populate the `~/.codex-tools/xuunity-mcp` and `~/.claude-tools/xuunity-mcp` installations.

## 6. Expected Behavior
1. Host helper initializes and creates Unix/Windows wrapper scripts.
2. Setup plan adds the Git UPM package reference into `<workspace>/Packages/manifest.json` and creates a project-specific bridge config in `<workspace>/Library/XUUnityLightMcp`.
3. Offline validation yields `ready`.
4. Launching the editor activates the local loopback TCP port transport and reports a healthy bridge status.
5. Batch EditMode tests run and report test outcomes (or report lack of tests).
6. Android compilation succeeds with 0 errors.
7. Editor shuts down cleanly post-execution.

## 7. Actual Behavior
- All expected outcomes occurred exactly as planned.
- EditMode tests completed with `"unity_outcome": "no_tests"` (verified that the project contains no test suites under the `Assets/` directory).
- Android target compilation completed successfully with status `passed`, compiling 27 assemblies with 0 errors.

## 8. First Failing Step
- **None** (Success).

## 9. Timeline of Attempted Actions
1. **Preflight**: Checked Python version (3.13.2) and generated setup plan JSON file.
2. **Initialize Helper**: Ran `init_xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh` to install server scripts under tools directories.
3. **Apply Setup**: Ran `setup-apply` to update the package manifest and establish the bridge configuration.
4. **Validation**: Ran `validate-setup` which returned status `ready`.
5. **Bridge Diagnostics**: Ran `ensure-ready --open-editor` which opened the Unity Editor, attached the bootstrap, and established the transport bridge.
6. **Tests Execution**: Ran `batch-editmode-tests` (returned exit code `1`, status `no_tests`).
7. **Editor Quitting**: Ran `restore-editor-state` to quit the Unity Editor process and verified exit using `verify-editor-closed`.
8. **Android Compilation**: Ran `batch-compile --target Android` (completed in 21 seconds with status `passed`, 0 errors).

## 10. Sanitized Package State
- **`<workspace>/Packages/manifest.json`**:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.unity.test-framework": "1.5.1",
    "com.xuunity.light-mcp": "https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.21"
  }
}
```

## 11. Sanitized MCP Client Config
- **Client type**: CLI Tool / No active desktop client was wired during this setup sequence.

## 12. Setup Helper Output Summary
- `validate-setup` output:
```json
{
  "action": "validate_setup",
  "package_dependency_state": "declared",
  "bridge_config_state": { "state": "enabled", "enabled": true },
  "test_capabilities_state": "supported",
  "validation_status": "ready"
}
```
- `ensure-ready` output:
```json
{
  "active_transport": "tcp_loopback",
  "health_classification": "fresh",
  "discovery_classification": "bridge_live",
  "reconciliation_status": "healthy"
}
```

## 13. Failure Classification
- **`none`** (Successful setup and execution).

## 14. Most Likely Causes
- N/A

## 15. Smallest Reproduction Steps
N/A

## 16. Attachments or Logs to Include
- Setup plan JSON file
- Batch compilation log (`Library/XUUnityLightMcp/logs/batch/20260608T215851Z_compile_Android.log`)
- EditMode tests execution log (`Library/XUUnityLightMcp/logs/batch/20260608T215637Z_editmode_tests.log`)

## 17. Redaction Notes
- All private paths have been mapped to `<workspace>` or `<appDataDir>`.

## 18. Maintainer Questions That Remain
- None. The toolset works perfectly out-of-the-box on this repository structure.
