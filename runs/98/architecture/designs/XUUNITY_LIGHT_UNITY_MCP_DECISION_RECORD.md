# XUUnity Light Unity MCP Decision Record

Date: `2026-05-15`
Status: `active source-of-truth decision record`
Scope: public rationale for why `XUUnityLightUnityMcp` exists and why it has its current shape

This document is the curated source of truth for the major design decisions
behind `XUUnityLightUnityMcp`.

It summarizes and supersedes these historical design inputs:

- `History/XUUNITY_UNITY_MCP_EVALUATION_AND_ADAPTER_DESIGN_2026-05-04.md`
- `History/XUUNITY_UNITY_MCP_FEATURE_MATRIX_AND_POLICY_2026-05-04.md`
- `History/XUUNITY_LIGHTWEIGHT_UNITY_MCP_SERVICE_DESIGN_2026-05-05.md`

Keep those history files for detailed background. Use this document when you
need to quickly understand what was decided and why.

## Core Decision

Build and maintain a small public `XUUnityLightUnityMcp` package instead of
standardizing `xuunity` directly on a broad existing Unity MCP backend.

The package should provide:

- a tiny local stdio MCP server
- a tiny editor-only Unity bridge package
- explicit project targeting
- structured validation evidence
- a narrow, high-trust operation surface
- public reusable templates and setup docs
- host-local wrappers outside public `AIRoot`

Existing public Unity MCP projects remain valuable reference material, but they
are not the runtime dependency for the standard `xuunity` validation path.

## Why Not Use A Broad Existing Backend Directly

Broad Unity MCP packages proved useful for research and feature discovery, but
they did not match the desired default `xuunity` shape.

Main concerns:

- too much dependency mass for a validation-first workflow
- possible player-build/runtime footprint
- capability surfaces that invite mutation before trust is established
- dynamic script execution and reflection-style escape hatches
- package mutation and broad asset mutation capabilities
- more setup and lifecycle machinery than the daily workflow needs
- raw vendor tool names would leak into stable `xuunity` behavior

The conclusion was not "avoid MCP." The conclusion was:

- use MCP for real Unity-aware validation
- keep the default bridge small
- keep broad vendor surfaces as references and comparison points
- expose only the operations that produce reliable engineering evidence

## Why A Lightweight Custom Package Is The Better Default

The daily `xuunity` loop needs a dependable Unity-aware proof path, not a
generic AI game platform.

The default package optimizes for:

- trust
- clarity
- small blast radius
- fast onboarding
- stable structured evidence
- easy removal
- no player-build impact by default

This supports the most common engineering questions:

- Is the intended Unity project open and reachable?
- Is the editor healthy or busy?
- What does the console say?
- What scene is active?
- Can Unity compile this target/profile path?
- Do selected EditMode or PlayMode tests pass?
- Can an ordered scenario produce durable evidence?

## Architecture Decision

Use two parts:

1. external MCP server process
2. Unity Editor bridge package

Do not add a third service, runtime game component, cloud relay, or dependency
stack in the base design.

High-level shape:

```text
MCP client
  -> local stdio MCP server
    -> project-scoped request broker
      -> Unity Editor bridge
        -> Unity Editor APIs
```

Responsibilities:

- External server:
  - speak MCP over stdio
  - validate project targeting
  - normalize tool inputs and outputs
  - manage request IDs and timeouts
  - expose the public tool surface
- Unity bridge:
  - run only in the Unity Editor
  - publish heartbeat, health, capabilities, and lifecycle state
  - execute registered operations
  - write structured results and durable artifacts

## Transport Decision

Start with local file IPC under:

- `<Project>/Library/XUUnityLightMcp/`

Reason:

- zero network stack
- zero auth/token setup for same-user local use
- no SignalR, WebSocket, relay, or HTTP dependency
- easier debugging from disk
- lower implementation risk during Unity reloads
- all mutable bridge state stays outside source and outside `Assets/`

The design later added a loopback TCP transport as an operational improvement,
but the base trust model remains same-host, same-user, explicitly targeted
Unity editor work.

HTTP or remote transports are not the default. They may be future extensions,
but they should not change the base package's local-first trust boundary.

## Packaging Decision

The Unity package must be editor-only.

Base rules:

- package id: `com.xuunity.light-mcp`
- public source: `AIRoot/Operations/XUUnityLightUnityMcp/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp`
- no runtime asmdef in the base package
- no generated source under `Assets/`
- no player-build footprint by default
- no package mutation beyond the project manifest entry
- all bridge state under `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/`

Host-local development may use a local `file:` dependency. Production project
wiring should pin to a published public git commit.

## Tool Surface Policy

The tool surface is intentionally small. The goal is not maximum tool count.
The goal is high-confidence Unity evidence.

### Band A: Daily Core

Expose as first-class operations:

- editor readiness and status
- health and capabilities
- console read/tail
- active scene snapshot
- active scene assertion
- EditMode tests
- PlayMode tests where configured
- player-script compile gates
- ordered scenario execution
- Game View screenshot as supporting evidence

These operations are low mutation, high signal, and useful in normal feature,
bugfix, review, and SDK validation work.

### Band B: Guarded Extensions

Useful, but only behind explicit intent and narrow scope:

- bounded asset and object inspection
- screenshot and Game View configuration
- project-defined hooks
- profile/environment apply hooks
- local data cleanup hooks
- narrow project-owned scenario actions

These can mutate project/editor state or create misleading evidence if used
casually. They require clear target scope, cleanup expectations, and follow-up
validation.

### Band C: Disabled By Default

Do not expose as normal workflow primitives:

- package add/remove
- arbitrary dynamic C# execution
- broad reflection method calls
- broad scene or hierarchy mutation
- broad asset mutation or delete
- runtime in-game MCP connection
- remote/cloud relay operation

These may be valid for specialized products or one-off investigations, but they
are not part of the standard `xuunity` validation path.

## Evidence Policy

MCP exists here to produce honest Unity evidence.

Rules:

- shell compile or source inspection must not be reported as Unity MCP
  validation
- if MCP is unavailable, the validation gap must remain explicit
- screenshots are supporting evidence, not sole proof
- tests, compile gates, scene assertions, health, and structured scenario
  results are stronger proof
- log clearing is disabled by default because it destroys context
- missing capabilities should become typed gaps or backlog, not hidden success

## Mutation Policy

Read operations come first. Mutations are allowed only when they are narrow,
intentional, and validated.

Mutation requirements:

- one concrete project root
- explicit target scope
- known cleanup or restore behavior
- follow-up status/health/compile/test/scenario evidence where applicable
- fail closed on ambiguous project, missing hook, missing cleanup, or unsafe
  secret input

Project-specific behavior belongs in project hooks and project operation
folders, not in the public bridge core.

## Adapter And Naming Decision

`xuunity` should rely on stable conceptual operations, not raw vendor tool
names.

Preferred conceptual names:

- `unity.status`
- `unity.console.tail`
- `unity.scene.snapshot`
- `unity.scene.assert`
- `unity.tests.run_editmode`
- `unity.tests.run_playmode`
- `unity.compile.player_scripts`
- `unity.scenario.run`

MCP-facing names may be client-friendly wrapper names such as:

- `unity_status`
- `unity_console_tail`
- `unity_scene_snapshot`
- `unity_scene_assert`

This keeps prompt/workflow logic stable even if public MCP protocol bindings,
client naming conventions, or underlying implementation details evolve.

## Host-Local Boundary Decision

Public `AIRoot` owns reusable package behavior:

- server templates
- Unity package templates
- public operations
- public design docs
- public setup and validation guidance

Host-local/project-local layers own:

- repo-specific wrapper commands
- project selection shortcuts
- project smoke scenarios
- project-defined hooks
- profile/environment names
- product-specific E2E flows
- confidential or project-bound evidence

Do not move project-specific behavior into the public bridge unless it has been
validated as reusable across projects and can be expressed without private
context.

## Reference Project Policy

Public Unity MCP projects are allowed and useful as public references.

Use them for:

- editor lifecycle research
- test execution quirks
- console capture edge cases
- scene/object serialization boundaries
- MCP client ergonomics
- custom tool registration patterns
- examples of capabilities to keep, hide, or reject

Do not inherit blindly:

- runtime support
- package mutation defaults
- dynamic code execution defaults
- heavyweight dependency graphs
- remote relay infrastructure
- raw broad tool surfaces

## Current Outcome

The current package follows the decision direction:

- public package under `AIRoot/Operations/XUUnityLightUnityMcp/`
- editor-only Unity package
- external server templates
- explicit project targeting
- scenario runner
- health/capability reporting
- scene snapshot and scene assertion
- compile/test primitives
- Game View evidence primitives
- project-defined hook escape valve
- host-local consumer-project profile scenarios kept outside public `AIRoot`

The design is still intentionally conservative. Future expansion should prefer
more evidence and better lifecycle robustness before adding broad mutation.

## Current Implementation Notes

This decision record describes the design direction and policy. The implemented
operation surface is intentionally a little wider than the daily evidence core
because the package also needs operational support tools for setup, recovery,
package refresh, and project-specific validation lanes.

Current core evidence operations include:

- `unity.status`
- `unity.capabilities.get`
- `unity.health.probe`
- `unity.console.tail`
- `unity.scene.snapshot`
- `unity.scene.assert`
- `unity.tests.run_editmode`
- `unity.tests.run_playmode`
- `unity.compile.player_scripts`
- `unity.compile.matrix`
- `unity.scenario.validate`
- `unity.scenario.run`
- `unity.scenario.result`
- `unity.game_view.configure`
- `unity.game_view.screenshot`

Current operational support operations include:

- `unity.build_target.get`
- `unity.build_target.switch`
- `unity.project.refresh`
- `unity.playmode.state`
- `unity.playmode.set`
- `unity.editor.quit`
- `unity.edm4u.resolve`
- `unity.sdk.dependency.verify`

These support operations are not a license for broad mutation. They exist to
make validation lanes deterministic and recoverable:

- `unity.build_target.switch` is used only when a validation lane explicitly
  needs a build target transition.
- `unity.project.refresh` is used to settle Unity after package/profile/config
  mutations.
- `unity.playmode.set` is used by ordered scenarios with explicit state
  assertions.
- `unity.edm4u.resolve` and `unity.sdk.dependency.verify` are SDK validation
  helpers, not general package mutation tools.
- `unity.editor.quit` is an operational lifecycle command and should not be
  treated as routine feature-work behavior.

The Unity package core does not depend on Unity's Test Framework package. Test
execution is an optional capability: the Test Framework assembly compiles only
when Unity asmdef Version Defines set `XUUNITY_LIGHT_MCP_TESTS_CAPABILITY`
because `com.unity.test-framework >= 1.1.33` is present. Missing optional test
support is reported as a capability status, not as whole-MCP health failure.

When code depends on Unity Editor APIs that vary by editor version, prefer
Unity's built-in version symbols such as `UNITY_2021_3_OR_NEWER`,
`UNITY_2022_3_OR_NEWER`, and `UNITY_6000_0_OR_NEWER` once the boundary is
known. If the boundary is uncertain, use a narrow reflection/fallback wrapper
so Unity 2021 remains compile-safe and add a static test to prevent direct
references to unavailable APIs from creeping back in.

The package still intentionally does not expose:

- arbitrary C# execution
  - Useful for one-off editor diagnostics, emergency repair scripts, or
    exploratory automation when no typed operation exists.
  - Not default because it bypasses typed contracts, reviewable operation
    boundaries, and normal compile/test feedback loops.
- broad reflection method call
  - Useful for inspecting or invoking Unity/editor internals that do not have a
    supported public API.
  - Not default because it is brittle across Unity versions and can bypass
    intended safety checks.
- broad package add/remove
  - Useful for dependency onboarding, SDK migration experiments, and automated
    package upgrade probes.
  - Not default because it mutates project dependencies, triggers reload/import
    churn, and can break unrelated validation lanes. The narrow approved
    `unity.package.install_test_framework` operation exists only to enable the
    optional Test Framework capability after explicit approval.
- broad asset delete/mutation
  - Useful for asset cleanup, migration, generated content repair, or bulk
    project refactors.
  - Not default because asset changes can be destructive, noisy, and difficult
    to review without precise target scoping.
- broad scene or hierarchy mutation
  - Useful for level-editing automation, prefab repair, generated scene setup,
    or UI hierarchy refactors.
  - Not default because scene/prefab mutations are high blast-radius and often
    require product-specific visual validation.
- runtime in-game MCP connection
  - Useful for live gameplay instrumentation, runtime state inspection, bot-like
    E2E flows, and game-specific debug/control surfaces.
  - Not default because it adds player/runtime footprint and changes the trust
    model from editor validation to in-game control.
- remote/cloud relay operation
  - Useful for remote CI agents, shared lab devices, distributed QA, or hosted
    editor automation.
  - Not default because it introduces network exposure, authentication, routing,
    and multi-user trust concerns that the same-host editor workflow avoids.

## Decision Checklist For Future Changes

Before adding a new MCP capability, answer:

1. Is it editor-only by default?
2. Does it produce evidence or only convenience?
3. Can it target one concrete project/root/object?
4. Is it read-only, or does it have a cleanup/restore contract?
5. Can it fail with a typed, useful gap?
6. Does it avoid player-build footprint?
7. Does it avoid broad dynamic code execution?
8. Does it belong in public core, or should it be a project hook?
9. Does it keep returned data bounded and structured?
10. Does it make the default `xuunity` loop more trustworthy?

If the answer is weak, keep the capability guarded, project-local, or in
backlog/spec form.
