# Unity Package CI And Release Tag Gate

Date: `2026-08-14`
Status: `current for v0.3.72`

This document describes the automated Unity package CI gates and the release
tag gate that blocks tag preparation on failed or missing gates.

## Unity Package CI Workflow

`.github/workflows/unity-package-ci.yml` currently runs on `workflow_dispatch`
only, because the runner Unity license secrets are not configured yet. The
release tag gate still requires this workflow green for the release SHA, so
releases stay blocked until licensing is set up — that block is the intended
behavior, not a bug to route around.

Restore the `push` (branch `master`, no path filter) and `pull_request`
triggers once the secrets exist. The master push trigger must stay path-filter
free: every master SHA has to carry Unity gate evidence so the release tag gate
never reports a missing gate for a release commit.

The matrix compiles the package and runs its shipped EditMode and PlayMode
self-tests on two supported Unity lines:

- Unity `2022.3.62f1`
- Unity `6000.0.58f2`

Each line runs two project lanes:

- `ugui`: the consumer project installs `com.unity.ugui` (plus
  `com.unity.textmeshpro` on pre-6000 lines), so the capability-gated uGUI and
  TMP test assemblies compile and run.
- `no-ugui`: the consumer project installs neither, proving the package and its
  core test assemblies compile and pass in a project without uGUI.

Each job scaffolds a clean consumer project with
`scripts/testing/scaffold_unity_ci_project.py`, which references the in-repo
package through a `file:` dependency, lists it in `testables`, and pins
`com.unity.test-framework` through the same version policy the setup wizard
uses. Tests execute through `game-ci/unity-test-runner@v4.3.1` with the pinned
editor image `unityci/editor:ubuntu-<version>-base-3` and `testMode: all`.
Result XML files are uploaded as workflow artifacts.

## Unity License Secrets

Unity batch runs in CI require an activated license. The workflow reads these
repository secrets:

- `UNITY_LICENSE`: the full contents of a personal `.ulf` license file, or
- `UNITY_EMAIL` + `UNITY_PASSWORD` + `UNITY_SERIAL` for serial-based licenses.

A preflight job fails with an explicit error when neither secret set is
configured. That failure is intentional and must not be converted into a skip:
a skipped Unity gate would read as a passed one, and the release tag gate
would let an unproven package ship.

## Current Waiver

Licensing is externally blocked right now, so `Unity Package CI` is suspended in
`scripts/testing/check_release_ci_gates.py` through the `WAIVED_GATES` table
instead of being deleted from the required set. A waiver is not a pass:

- the gate keeps the workflow in `RELEASE_GATE_WORKFLOWS`, so its name is still
  pinned to a checked-in workflow and a rename cannot make the restore a no-op
- every run reports a `waived_gates` entry with the reason, the concrete
  evidence gap, and the restore condition, and prints it on stderr
- a run with a waiver reports `status=ok_with_waived_gates`, never plain `ok`
- release notes for anything cut under the waiver must state the gap

Restore by dropping the `WAIVED_GATES` entry once the secrets exist and the
workflow's automatic triggers are back. `check_release_ci_gates.py --require
"Unity Package CI"` re-arms it for a single run without editing the table.

Fork pull requests do not receive repository secrets, so the Unity jobs are
skipped there. Fork-PR runs are not release evidence: the release gate only
accepts `push` and `workflow_dispatch` runs.

## Release Tag Gate

Release/tag preparation is blocked on the required CI gates in two places:

1. Locally, before pushing a tag:

```bash
python3 scripts/testing/check_release_ci_gates.py --wait-seconds 1800
```

The script queries the GitHub Actions runs for the release SHA (default: the
repo HEAD) and requires a completed, successful `push` or `workflow_dispatch`
run for each required workflow: `Integration Tests` (the Python suite on
Windows, macOS, and Linux), `Unity Package CI`, and `Discovery Checks`. A
failing, still-running, or missing gate exits non-zero — do not push the tag.
`--wait-seconds` bounds an optional poll loop for gates that are still
running; set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to avoid anonymous API rate limits.

2. In CI, on every tag push: `.github/workflows/release-tag-gate.yml` runs the
same script against the tagged SHA. A tag cut against a red, pending, or
missing gate produces a public failing run on that tag.

`tests/test_ci_workflow_contract.py` pins the workflow display names to the
gate script's required set, so renaming a workflow without updating the gate
fails the host suite.

## Local Equivalence Lane

The same scaffold + batch test path runs locally without GitHub:

```bash
python3 scripts/testing/scaffold_unity_ci_project.py --project-root /tmp/CiProject --unity-version <version> --lane no-ugui
"<unity-editor-path>" -batchmode -projectPath /tmp/CiProject -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -testResults /tmp/CiProject-editmode.xml -logFile /tmp/CiProject-editmode.log
"<unity-editor-path>" -batchmode -projectPath /tmp/CiProject -runTests -testPlatform PlayMode -testResults /tmp/CiProject-playmode.xml -logFile /tmp/CiProject-playmode.log
```

The richer interactive matrix (bridge, scenarios, license-aware batch compile)
remains available through `scripts/testing/run_unity_version_matrix.sh`.
