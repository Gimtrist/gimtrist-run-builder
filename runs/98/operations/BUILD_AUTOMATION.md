# Build Automation Surface

Date: `2026-05-26`
Status: `current for v0.3.72-dev`

This document defines the public-safe build automation surface for the
standalone `xuunity-mcp` repository.

The goal is to keep the public contract generic enough for:
- plain Unity projects that only need normal batch builds
- projects with build profiles or config assets
- projects with custom build tooling that still want to reuse MCP orchestration

## Implemented Now

Current public operations:
- `unity.build_target.get`
- `unity.build_target.switch`
- `unity.compile.player_scripts`
- `unity.compile.matrix`
- `unity.build_player`
- `unity_compile_build_config_matrix`
- `unity_license_capabilities`
- `unity.edm4u.resolve`
- `unity.sdk.android_resolve`
- `unity.sdk.dependency.verify`
- `unity_status_summary`
- `unity_request_final_status`
- `unity_scenario_result_summary`
- `unity_scenario_results_list`
- `unity_scenario_result_latest`
- `unity_scenario_run_and_wait`
- `unity_maintenance_prune`

Current public scenario hook lane:
- `project_defined_hook`

Current public host-side batch helpers:
- `batch-compile`
- `batch-compile-matrix`
- `batch-build-config-compile-matrix`
- `batch-editmode-tests`
- `batch-build-player`
- `artifact-probe`
- `license-capabilities`

## Lane Selection Rule

Treat the build and validation surface as two different classes of work:

- interactive control-plane work
- batch data-plane work

Use the interactive MCP lane for:
- `ensure-ready`
- `unity.status`
- `unity.health.probe`
- `unity.console.tail`
- `unity.scene.snapshot`
- `unity.playmode.*`
- `unity.game_view.*`
- compile validation
- deterministic EditMode tests when the editor must stay open
- project config inspection
- SDK package restore, EDM4U resolver triggering, and generated dependency artifact verification
- project-defined smoke and hook flows that are short-lived and editor-bound

Use the batch lane for:
- artifact builds
- signed package generation
- long-running export pipelines
- end-to-end build flows where success should be judged by process exit and generated outputs

For third-party SDK updates, prefer this validation order:
1. project refresh with package resolve
2. compile validation for affected Android/iOS targets
3. switch and settle the active build target to Android
4. `unity.sdk.android_resolve` with tracked generated paths and explicit
   expected coordinates. It requires EDM4U callback success, stable SHA-256
   outputs across idle ticks, and dependency proof. Use `unity.edm4u.resolve`
   only when fire-and-report evidence is sufficient and retain its
   non-decision-ready classification.
5. `unity.sdk.dependency.verify` for additional generated resolver files or iOS
   outputs not covered by the typed Android config
6. `unity_sdk_generated_diff_guard` against the approved generated-file baseline
7. batch export or player build
8. generated artifact inspection, such as Gradle output, Xcode export, Podfile.lock, manifest, plist, or dependency reports
9. device/runtime validation through project hooks or manual QA when SDK behavior depends on native runtime services

Minimal dependency verification payload:

```json
{
  "stopOnFirstFailure": false,
  "expectations": [
    {
      "id": "android-resolver-package",
      "platform": "Android",
      "path": "ProjectSettings/AndroidResolverDependencies.xml",
      "kind": "android_resolver_package",
      "value": "com.vendor:artifact:1.2.3"
    },
    {
      "id": "android-repository",
      "platform": "Android",
      "path": "Assets/Plugins/Android/settingsTemplate.gradle",
      "kind": "gradle_repository",
      "value": "https://vendor.example/maven"
    },
    {
      "id": "ios-pod",
      "platform": "iOS",
      "path": "Builds/iOS/MyExport/Podfile.lock",
      "kind": "podfile_lock_pod",
      "value": "VendorPod",
      "version": "1.2.3"
    }
  ]
}
```

Do not use the live interactive scenario lane as the primary waiter for
long-running artifact builds. It is the right control plane for editor-aware
inspection and short bounded work, but it is the wrong data plane for build
correctness.

## License-Aware Batch Fallback

Before a public `batch-*` command starts Unity batchmode, the host wrapper checks
the actual execution capability for the resolved editor and project:

```bash
python3 templates/server.py \
  license-capabilities \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --refresh \
  --timeout-ms 30000
```

The report intentionally treats capability as the source of truth instead of
claiming a precise legal edition when Unity does not expose one. Important fields:
- `batchmode_supported`
- `editor_ui_supported`
- `license_kind_inferred`
- `batchmode_blocker_code`
- `batchmode_probe_log_path`
- `recommended_execution_lane`
- `source_evidence`

Known batch blockers are normalized as stable codes:
- `no_valid_editor_license`
- `access_token_unavailable`
- `no_ulf_license`
- `headless_entitlement_missing`
- `licensing_client_ipc_failure`
- `unknown_batch_failure`

Batch helpers accept:

```bash
--batch-fallback-mode auto|off|require-batch
```

Default `auto` behavior:
- run real batchmode when `batchmode_supported=true`
- use the equivalent GUI bridge operation when a known blocker proves batchmode
  unavailable and editor UI fallback is not known to be unavailable
- reuse an already-open editor only when it is idle in Edit Mode
- open a closed project, run the GUI operation, then restore/close the
  host-opened editor and require verified process exit
- fail closed on `process_visibility_restricted` because restore safety cannot
  be proven

`off` keeps the historical batch behavior but still includes license diagnostics.
`require-batch` fails unless real batchmode support is proven.

Structured summaries include:
- `requested_execution_lane`
- `effective_execution_lane`
- `lane_fallback_reason`
- `license_batchmode_supported`
- `license_blocker_code`
- `start_editor_state`
- `restore_editor_state`
- `gui_fallback_log_path`
- `next_distinct_action`

Relevant Unity constraints are documented by Unity: batchmode is a command-line
Editor mode, Personal activation is Hub-oriented rather than serial/manual CLI,
Build Server licenses do not provide normal Editor UI, and closed-platform builds
can require Pro or platform entitlement. The MCP therefore probes capability and
reports evidence instead of hard-coding edition names.

## Scenario Lane Constraint

The interactive scenario lane is intentionally serialized.

Operational implications:
- do not schedule parallel scenario runs against the same project/editor session
- treat `scenario_already_running` as a contract signal, not as a flaky transport error
- wrappers should surface this constraint clearly instead of pretending the lane is fully concurrent

If the workflow needs:
- parallel work
- long waits
- artifact production
- or transport-independent closeout proof

move that work to a batch helper or to a narrower direct request flow instead of
stacking more logic onto `unity.scenario.run`.

This means the public layer already covers:
- current active platform inspection
- deterministic platform switching
- compile validation without switching active build target
- compile and EditMode validation when the target project is closed
- compact polling/status surfaces
- request-level recovery follow-up after transport churn
- cleanup of request/scenario/capture artifacts
- typed project hook execution inside scenarios

## Build Tiers

Promote public behavior in three tiers.

### 1. Plain Batch Build

Use for simple Unity projects with no custom build profiles.

Expected contract:
- build from current editor state or explicit target
- optional target switch before build
- optional artifact-only mode
- optional reopen-editor behavior handled by the host wrapper

The public layer should own orchestration, not project-specific settings mutation.

Current minimal host-side command:

```bash
python3 templates/server.py \
  batch-compile \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --target Android
```

Define-matrix validation and deterministic EditMode tests use the same closed-project batch lane:

```bash
python3 templates/server.py \
  batch-build-config-compile-matrix \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject

python3 templates/server.py \
  batch-editmode-tests \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --assembly-name MyProject.Tests
```

Plain artifact builds still use:

```bash
python3 templates/server.py \
  batch-build-player \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --build-target Android \
  --output-path Builds/Android/MyGame.apk
```

Important limitation:
- `unity_build_player`, `request-build-player`, and `batch-build-player` are
  plain Unity `BuildPipeline` lanes. They may be non-representative for
  projects whose real build requires a project BuildTool, profile application,
  signing setup, dependency generation, or custom pre/postprocessors.
- For those projects, expose a project-owned action such as `build.dev_android`
  that calls the same menu item or static build method the project uses for
  configured builds.

Generic config-applying project-action template:

```bash
python3 templates/server.py \
  project-action-invoke \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --action-id build.dev_android \
  --allow-mutating \
  --timeout-ms 600000
```

Starter files:
- `templates/project_actions/config_applying_build.project_actions.yaml`
- `templates/project_actions/ConfigApplyingBuildActionHook.cs.template`

The project should replace placeholder hook names, menu paths, static method
names, profile labels, artifact paths, and mutation/evidence lists with its own
public-safe contract. Keep generated artifacts and private signing/provider
details out of the public template.

Batch helpers emit compact progress events as JSON lines and write the same
events to:

```text
Library/XUUnityLightMcp/logs/batch/<run_id>/progress.jsonl
```

Default progress behavior:
- first event at preflight/prepare
- periodic `unity_batch_running` heartbeats every 30 seconds while Unity is
  still alive
- final events for side-effect scan and summary writing
- `--no-progress-stdout` keeps only the JSONL sidecar
- `--progress-interval-seconds` can be lowered for local smoke fixtures

Batch helpers also report tracked workspace side effects:

```bash
python3 templates/server.py \
  batch-build-player \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --build-target Android \
  --workspace-root /path/to/repo \
  --side-effect-allow-file /path/to/allowed-side-effects.json
```

The summary separates:
- `preexisting_dirty_paths`
- `allowed_new_dirty_paths`
- `unexpected_new_dirty_paths`

It never restores files automatically. Cleanup commands are recommendations
only and are not emitted for paths that were already dirty before the batch
command.

Artifact probes can be attached to `batch-build-player`:

```bash
python3 templates/server.py \
  batch-build-player \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --build-target Android \
  --output-path Builds/Android/MyGame.apk \
  --artifact-probe-file /path/to/probes.json
```

The same generic probe runner can inspect an existing artifact without
rebuilding:

```bash
python3 templates/server.py \
  artifact-probe \
  --artifact-path Builds/Android/MyGame.apk \
  --artifact-probe-file /path/to/probes.json
```

P0 probe kinds:
- `zip_entry_exists`
- `zip_entry_absent`
- `zip_entry_glob_exists`
- `android_manifest_contains`
- `file_exists`
- `file_contains`

If artifact probing is enabled, failed probes make the command fail unless
`--artifact-probe-warn-only` is passed. Final JSON separates
`build_succeeded` from `artifact_probe_succeeded`.

Notes:
- this lane is intentionally plain
- it expects the same Unity project editor to be closed before execution
- another Unity editor process for a different project does not block this lane
- if the same project editor is open, use
  `request-editor-quit --project-root <project> --timeout-ms 30000 --wait-for-exit --exit-timeout-ms 30000`
  and then `verify-editor-closed --project-root <project> --timeout-ms 30000`
  before retrying
- if batchmode is blocked by license/Hub/headless state, default
  `--batch-fallback-mode auto` uses the GUI bridge equivalent when safe; this is
  a valid command-success path when Unity reports a passed outcome
- use `--batch-fallback-mode require-batch` for CI lanes that must fail without
  proven batchmode support
- host process visibility must be available; `process_visibility_restricted`
  means the lane cannot prove the editor is closed
- it uses the current project settings and enabled scenes unless scenes are passed explicitly
- it is suitable for simple projects and CI lanes, not for custom per-project restore workflows
- it is valid for compile, compile-matrix, and deterministic EditMode test work
- it is not a substitute for Play Mode, Game View, scene-state inspection, or other interactive editor evidence

### 2. Profile-Aware Batch Build

Use when a project exposes named build profiles or config assets.

Expected adapter surface:
- list profiles
- resolve profile by name
- apply profile using the project's real apply flow
- build after apply

Important rule:
- the public layer must not assume a specific asset path, profile schema, or profile names
- the project adapter owns those details
- the public layer should still own lane selection, timeout posture, artifact collection, and closeout reporting

### 3. Custom Tool Build

Use when the project already has a full custom build pipeline with versioning,
SDK sync, signing, third-party processors, evidence collection, or restore logic.

Expected split:
- public MCP layer owns orchestration and typed phases
- project adapter owns the actual tool-specific build behavior

## Typed Hook Phases

When exposing project build hooks through MCP, prefer typed phases over
one-off ad hoc hook names.

Recommended phases:
- `pre_apply`
- `post_apply`
- `pre_build`
- `post_build`
- `collect_evidence`
- `restore_state`

Hook payload shape should stay JSON-only:

```json
{
  "phase": "pre_build",
  "target": "Android",
  "profileName": "ProfileA",
  "context": {
    "artifactOnly": true
  }
}
```

Hook response shape should stay JSON-only:

```json
{
  "outcome": "completed",
  "changedFiles": [
    "ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset"
  ],
  "evidence": {
    "bundleVersion": "1.2.3"
  }
}
```

## State Safety Rules

Public orchestration should assume build automation is stateful and risky.

Default expectations:
- do not leave target switches ambiguous
- do not acknowledge success before the real outcome is known
- prefer batch execution for artifact-only builds
- define explicit restore boundaries for project-managed files
- emit compact summaries so callers do not need to read large logs
- emit compact failure summaries for failed prepare/build phases before sending
  callers to raw logs

For profile-aware or custom-tool builds, default automation posture should be
non-destructive:
- do not enable autorun by default for artifact automation
- do not persist version or config mutations by default
- restore tracked project state unless the caller explicitly opts into persistence
- record whether the editor was closed and reopened as part of the automation

Recommended generic automation-policy fields:
- `artifact_only`
- `allow_autorun`
- `persist_version_updates`
- `persist_config_changes`
- `reopen_editor_after_build`

The exact project flags can vary, but the public orchestration contract should
preserve these semantics.

## Evidence Hierarchy

For build-sensitive work, trust generated outputs above source-only reasoning.

Preferred evidence order:
1. process exit code
2. generated artifact presence
3. generated manifest / plist / Gradle / Xcode output
4. compact build summary artifact
5. source manifest or processor inspection

Practical rule:
- if the question is whether a build processor or postprocess step changed the
  produced app correctly, inspect generated output first
- do not claim artifact correctness from source inspection alone when generated
  build evidence is available

This matters especially for:
- Android manifest injection
- network security config generation
- plist or entitlement mutation
- third-party postprocess build hooks
- signed package/export pipelines

## Cleanup and Token Discipline

The public surface should avoid forcing callers to inspect large raw logs.

Preferred pattern:
- read compact status summaries first
- resolve ambiguous lifecycle-reset requests by request id before rerunning them
- read compact scenario summaries second
- inspect full logs only on failure or unresolved ambiguity
- prune old request journals and scenario results routinely

For batch builds, the same rule applies:

- a successful run should end in a compact build result artifact
- a failed run should still end in a compact failure summary artifact with:
  - phase: `prepare` or `build`
  - transport outcome
  - Unity operation outcome when known
  - top actionable error or blocker
  - paths to the next raw logs only as second-line evidence
- batch wrapper stdout should surface that summary artifact path directly instead
  of dumping large raw result payloads or large log tails by default

- the compact result should also name the strongest generated evidence that was
  inspected, for example:
  - artifact path
  - build report path
  - generated manifest/plist path
  - whether tracked state was restored

This keeps operator diagnosis bounded even when `prepare.log` or `build.log`
are large.

Current cleanup command:

```bash
python3 templates/server.py \
  maintenance-prune \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --dry-run
```

## What Stays Project-Local

Do not promote these into the public reusable repo:
- project-specific asset paths
- project-specific profile names
- project-specific restore file lists
- custom signing conventions
- product-specific output validation rules
- project-private SDK knowledge
