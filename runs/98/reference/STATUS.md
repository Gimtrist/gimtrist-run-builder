# Status

Date: `2026-09-04`
Status: `active public status snapshot`

XUUnity Light Unity MCP is a working same-host Unity Editor automation service
for MCP-capable AI agents. The current released source line is `v0.3.72`.

## Current Package

Unity package:

```text
com.xuunity.light-mcp
```

Current Git UPM URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.72
```

Current package path:

```text
packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp
```

Release `v0.3.72` adds first-class compiler-warning evidence to direct,
matrix, batch, and multi-project compile summaries. `warning_count` counts
occurrences, `unique_warning_count` deduplicates diagnostic identities, and a
bounded `warnings` sample preserves file/line/code/severity/message details.
Warnings remain non-fatal; `status` continues to reflect compile errors. The
separate rebuilt-versus-cache-hit evidence gap remains open.

Migration note:

- `v0.3.11` and earlier used `templates/unity-package`.
- `v0.3.12+` uses `packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp`.
- `v0.3.14+` keeps the default package metadata on Unity `2021.3` and makes
  Test Framework-backed operations optional.
- `v0.3.15+` adds license-aware batch fallback and Codex helper install-target
  selection.
- `v0.3.29+` adds project-defined hook poll-until scenarios and richer compact
  scenario summaries.
- `v0.3.32+` makes `unity_scenario_run_and_wait` a compact decision-verdict
  surface by default, with lifecycle relaunch attribution and full-payload
  opt-in.
- `v0.3.34+` makes refresh, compile, build-config compile, and direct test MCP
  responses compact by default while preserving authoritative post-settle
  verdict fields and `includeFullPayload=true` recovery.
- Current source preserves both callback-time and host-idle Play Mode states on
  direct test responses and their matching persisted test result. The
  compatibility field names its source; a disagreement is explicit and never
  changes the callback-derived test verdict or totals. Full and compact
  final-status recovery preserve the same fields, including explicit legacy
  source labeling and lifecycle-churn accounting.
- Current source qualifies refresh `playmode_state_after_settle` with explicit
  source/trust metadata; bridge identity churn yields `stale_risk` and directs
  PlayMode-sensitive callers to confirm via `unity_playmode_state`.
- Current source also keeps a terminal scenario inconclusive when a confirmed
  project-hook `*_applied` mutation is followed by passive wait/status steps
  and a refresh or compile-settle failure, while explicitly separating the
  applied mutation from the unproven settle and disabling replay.
- Current source classifies every other scenario refresh-settle timeout from
  Unity-side evidence captured at the timeout instant (package settle,
  compile/import churn, busy editor, incomplete idle confirmation, or lost
  final accounting; host health adds `editor_failure`, and older-package
  results classify as `unclassified_legacy_payload`). The scenario summary and
  decision verdict promote a `refresh_timeout_recovery` block with a concrete
  recovery command and the explicit note that the Unity operation may have
  completed; the recommended next action becomes
  `request_status_summary_then_compile_gate` while the editor is reachable.
- Current source returns compact envelopes by default from `unity_scene_open`,
  `unity_scene_snapshot`, and `unity_game_view_configure`: the duplicated host
  lifecycle block is dropped, scene/view facts are preserved (including
  `root_object_count`), and `includeFullPayload=true` opts back into the full
  bridge payload — completing the compact-by-default contract across the
  interactive scene/playmode/view loop.
- Current source byte-bounds console tail payloads: `unity_console_tail` and
  the `console_tail` scenario step enforce a deterministic `maxPayloadBytes`
  ceiling (default `16384`, `-1` for the unbounded raw tail) in the Unity
  bridge, with a host-side fallback for older packages, oldest-first drops, an
  explicit newest-item truncation marker, full accounting fields, and
  `unity_console_grep` named as the compact recovery tool on truncation.
  In-memory Console tail also suppresses stack traces by default and exposes
  `includeStackTraces=true` as an explicit signal-expansion control.
- Current source makes anchored Editor.log grep absence trustworthy: a bounded
  `unity_console_grep source=editor_log` window stays adjacent to its resolved
  anchor so boot/init evidence is searched first, and any truncated zero-match
  is promoted to `search_verdict=inconclusive` with the window direction,
  partial-scope trust class, and a concrete recovery action. A complete
  anchored zero-match is explicitly `not_matched`; `unity_console_tail` keeps
  its separate recent-tail semantics.
  Operators can raise `maxSearchChars` without leaving the tool, and anchors
  from another editor PID resolve to `anchor_process_mismatch` rather than a
  false complete negative.
- Current source adds automated Unity package CI and a release tag gate: the
  `Unity Package CI` workflow compiles the package and runs EditMode/PlayMode
  self-tests on Unity `2022.3` and `6000.0` in `ugui` and `no-ugui` consumer
  lanes, a missing license secret fails loudly instead of skipping, and
  `scripts/testing/check_release_ci_gates.py` blocks tag preparation until
  `Integration Tests`, `Unity Package CI`, and `Discovery Checks` are green for
  the release SHA (re-verified in CI by the `Release Tag Gate` workflow).
- Current source adds a capability-gated uGUI PlayMode package test assembly.
  It drives the real guarded-click scenario-step path and proves exactly-once
  delivery, a decision-bearing receipt, semantic state change, the runtime
  Play Mode claim, and refusal without a receipt. The dependency-free core
  PlayMode lane remains available to projects without uGUI.
- Current source keeps passive `project_defined_hook_poll_until` readiness
  snapshots running through `status: not_started`; explicit pass/fail
  predicates still win, unmatched statuses still fail closed, and timeout stays
  authoritative.
- Current source promotes the standardized `xuunity.mutation-delta.v1` payload
  from project-defined hooks. `unity_project_action_invoke` keeps Unity
  execution success separate from acceptance: a completed mutating action is
  decision-ready only with a valid, non-destructive delta; missing/invalid
  proof or removals/count shrink produce an explicit mutation trust class,
  operator verdict, warning, and review action. Non-decision-ready verdicts
  name the schema and carry `mutation_delta_contract_doc` pointing at the
  worked contract example.
- Current source gives every catalog-backed project action a shared
  `project_action_currency` preflight. It compares the loaded editor-domain
  timestamp with the newest editor input under `Assets` and blocks stale or
  unknown domains before hook execution. Catalog actions marked
  `requiresFreshAssets: true` automatically run a forced AssetDatabase refresh,
  wait for settle/domain reload, re-check currency, and then invoke the hook.
  The standalone `unity_project_action_currency` tool and
  `unity_status_summary` expose the same evidence.
- Background execution is opt-in: the editor's `Application.runInBackground` is
  backed by `PlayerSettings.runInBackground`, so the bridge changes it only when
  the project's bridge config sets `background_execution_enabled: true`, and
  restores the original value on disable or editor quit.
  `background_execution_mode` reports `managed` or `project_owned`. Native
  autofocus remains disabled and explicit in payloads; player-loop liveness is
  still the trust boundary.
- Current source closes the 2026-08-17 play-mode liveness retro P0/P1 set:
  the bridge heartbeat samples frame advance and editor focus, and
  `unity_playmode_state` / `unity.status` / `unity_status_summary` report
  `playmode_loop_liveness` with an explicit
  `playmode_throttled_editor_unfocused` warning when a playing loop stops
  advancing frames; the host compile gate covers `playmode_set` `enter` only
  (exit is remediation and is never gated; `unity.scenario.run` dispatch is
  deliberately ungated with step-level gates owning correctness);
  compiler-evidence payloads stamp `compiler_diagnostics_trust_class`;
  `unity_project_action_invoke` is compact by default; a catalog
  `payload.action` conflict is listed and refused instead of silently
  overridden; and `unity_status_summary` warns up front on a split log lane
  (`editor_launch_lane: not_opened_by_host`).
- Current source separates readiness observations from compile verdicts.
  Compiler-diagnostic text seen while waiting for the bridge is retained as an
  observation while transient bridge attach, editor identity, and
  compile/import busy states keep polling. If readiness never settles, the
  top-level result names the live condition or log-only observation and reports
  `compile_state=unmeasured`. Recovery stays non-destructive, and the embedded
  readiness prerequisite becomes blocking with the same code instead of
  simultaneously claiming `ready=true`.
- Current source prevents Unity Asset Import Workers from attaching the MCP
  bridge before any session, transport, heartbeat, or journal file is created.
  Host discovery also rejects older worker-owned state as
  `bridge_owned_by_non_main_process`, sets `runtime_execution_allowed=false`,
  and reports compile failure, error count, and diagnostics as unknown rather
  than accepting a worker's green state as main-editor truth. Bootstrap journal
  events now record writer pid, process class, and editor-log path.
- Current source adds a fail-closed published-package consumer rollout helper.
  It reconciles explicit and ignore-independent discovery sets before edits,
  proves the global Unity/license/write lane, requires a passing canary before
  fan-out, persists an atomic resumable ledger, gives bounded workers no
  diagnosis/release/process-kill authority, re-verifies owned PID identity
  before root cleanup, and returns compact decision evidence by default.
- Current source closes the licensing/dialog GUI-launch retro cluster:
  repeatable `--unity-arg` pass-through, typed live-process/bridge-never-attached
  diagnostics with Editor.log evidence, first-cause `scenario_invalid` output,
  constrained-hook define hints, catalog-declared host-scope refusals,
  enforced apply-then-gate sequencing, poll-until default continuation,
  `--json-only`, fixed Game View guidance, and identity-verified
  `request-editor-quit --force-after-ms` escalation.
- Current source closes the reusable 2026-09-03 greenfield-authoring retro
  backlog. UI reads/clicks, screenshots, and persisted scenario steps now carry
  point-of-use player-loop liveness and trust; UI/screenshot payloads separate
  effective Game View render dimensions from Unity `Screen.*`. Scenarios add
  `ui_exists` and `ui_get_text` alongside the existing guarded `ui_click`, with
  schema discovery and file-backed validation. Test verdicts expose
  request-scoped console-error pressure. The host accepts scalar setup
  `projectRoot`, exposes an approval-gated project-hook scaffold, and the
  package ships `XUUnityLightMcpMutationDelta.Create(...)` for measured hook
  proof.
- Current source makes `unity_ui_click` selector verdicts budget-aware. If
  `maxNodes` or `maxDepth` stops the UI walk, the direct tool and scenario step
  return `ui_selector_search_truncated` whether the scanned prefix found zero
  or one candidate, because neither absence nor uniqueness is proven. Their
  payloads preserve the searched scene scope, scenes not reached, node/depth
  budgets, node count, match count, and truncation reason; callers can narrow
  `targetKind` / `targetValue` / `sceneName` or raise the scenario's new
  `maxNodes` / `maxDepth` controls and retry.
  Delivered clicks now also require an observable semantic change before
  `success=true`; inert delivery reports `delivered_no_observable_effect` with
  raycast/log/hook remediation.
- Current source validates declared MCP argument types before any project
  resolution or Unity request. In particular, scalar test filters are rejected
  instead of widening to a full suite. Plain project-hook payload aliases are
  normalized or rejected rather than dropped, and status attributes request
  submissions by a domain-reload-stable `client_session_id` plus a
  `client_kind` of `mcp_server` or `cli`.
  `foreign_request_activity_detected` means a different long-lived client
  session submitted requests to this editor, so mutating work should pause
  until that session is identified. It does not mean the operator ran the
  wrapper CLI or a smoke suite against their own editor: that traffic is
  counted in `cli_requests_since_client_start` and is informational.
- `v0.3.38+` makes `unity_status_summary` compact by default for MCP callers,
  with `payload_mode` markers and full nested diagnostics available through
  `includeFullPayload=true`.
- `v0.3.39+` adds compact output for batch helper CLI commands; current source
  makes it the default while preserving `--output full` for diagnosis.
- `v0.3.67+` makes the multi-project compile runner consume that compact shape
  without losing Unity or transport outcomes. It falls back to named summary
  and Unity-confirmed result artifacts, records the chosen evidence source, and
  reports absent matrix counters as unavailable rather than zero.
- `v0.3.36+` makes `ensure-ready` compact by default,
  adds active editor-log identity and path-backed `editor_log` grep, removes
  duplicated scenario `run_start.steps` unless `includeStepPayloads=true`,
  adds post-change validation phase/churn dashboard output, and ships a
  public-safe config-applying project-action build template.
- The old path is kept only as a migration pointer for users pinned to
  `v0.3.11`.

OpenUPM status:

- the package layout is OpenUPM-ready
- the package is not documented as published on OpenUPM yet
- use Git UPM until the OpenUPM package page exists

## Current Surface

SDK rollout safety (`v0.3.45` plus current-source hardening):

- Android `unity.edm4u.resolve` now refuses to fire unless
  `BuildTarget.Android` is active and Android Build Support is loaded. Passing
  request payloads expose the target precondition while keeping
  `resolver_output_freshness=unproven` and `decision_ready=false`.
- Current source adds capability-gated `unity.sdk.android_resolve` /
  `unity_sdk_android_resolve` / `request-sdk-android-resolve`. It uses EDM4U's
  callback as completion proof, requires stable SHA-256 generated outputs across
  idle ticks, and verifies explicit expected coordinates before returning
  `trust_class=decision_grade` and `decision_ready=true`.
- Current source adds closed-project `unity.sdk.package_restore` /
  `unity_sdk_package_restore` / `request-sdk-package-restore`. Unity batchmode
  waits for an idle-stable registered package graph, publishes an atomic
  run-bound `xuunity.sdk-package-restore.v1` receipt with package ids/versions,
  dependency-XML hashes, and manifest/lock hashes, then exits. Missing receipts,
  nonzero exits, timeouts, an open project, or unproven exit all fail closed.
- `unity_sdk_generated_diff_guard` / `sdk-generated-diff-guard` provides the
  generated-file vertical slice of the SDK rollout gate. Git-tracked paths use
  a named Git ref; Git-untracked paths can use an explicit `Library/` capture
  bound to project path, Unity version, package-lock hash, and configured SDK
  versions. Capture rejects dirty trees, and comparison rejects stale
  fingerprints or tampered snapshots. The host-side compact proof also detects
  missing required markers, stale expected versions, unallowlisted changes,
  invalid structured files, and normalization-only XML/Gradle rewrites without
  opening Unity. Current source registers every published pass/fail JSON report
  as an `sdk_generated_diff_report` artifact and returns its hash plus registry
  pointer. GUI admission control, batch resolve, and portfolio orchestration
  remain separate open slices.

## Current Validation Evidence

Latest release and current-source validation for `v0.3.72`:

| Area | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package metadata | `packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp/package.json` | `name=com.xuunity.light-mcp`, `version=0.3.72`, `unity=2021.3`, no hard Test Framework dependency |
| Host Python tests | `scripts/testing/run_host_python_tests.sh` (release checks plus full discovery) | Full discovery passed `1057` tests with `14` expected platform skips, including live TCP loopback transport coverage. |
| `v0.3.72` Unity release lanes | A consumer project on Unity `6000.0.58f2` whose active build target is iOS — the configuration the Game View defect required | Package EditMode `159/159` and PlayMode `23` total (`21` passed, `2` conditional skips, `0` failed); a six-resolution Game View sweep scenario passed `19/19` steps with every capture's PNG header matching the requested size; a live identity-guarding button click delivered its production path with `pointer_raycast_evidence=event_system_raycast_resolves_to_handler`; authoritative post-settle compilation and verified editor closeout. Unity `2022.3.62f3` was not re-run for this release. |
| Historical play-mode liveness measurement | Interactive MCP observation of an unfocused editor in Play Mode | With `playmode_state=playing` and `health_status=healthy`, the payload reports `playmode_loop_liveness=throttled`, `playmode_frames_advanced_last_interval=0`, `editor_application_focused=false`, `playmode_liveness_warning=playmode_throttled_editor_unfocused`, and the focus/no-throttling remediation; `unity_status_summary` carries the same fields. |
| Current-source structural compile diagnostics | Focused host contract plus a live duplicate-reference fault injection on Unity `2022.3.62f3` | Focused refresh/compile/test envelope coverage passes `129/129`. A real duplicate `.asmdef` reference produced `assembly_definition_error` with session-scoped `Editor.log` evidence and recovered to authoritative compile green after probe removal. Package tests passed EditMode `68/68` and PlayMode `18` passed with one expected skip; the editor was closed and consumer manifest/lock bytes were restored. |
| Compact MCP envelopes | Changelog and regression coverage for `0.3.32`-`0.3.53` | Scenario decision verdicts, compact operation/readiness/status summaries, authoritative post-settle compile/test/refresh fields, editor-log identity, scenario step-payload opt-ins, PlayMode already-playing stale-risk summaries, deterministic scene-open setup, opt-in compact batch helper output, safer `Editor.log` console grep/tail defaults, compact transport/idle timeout errors, compile-first post-change validation, lane-agnostic GUI-fallback compile evidence, and requested-filter zero-match verdicts are documented with full-payload recovery. |
| `v0.3.53` release package tests | Clean devmode projects on installed Unity editors | Unity `2022.3.62f3` and `6000.0.58f2` each pass EditMode `62/62` and dependency-free PlayMode `5/5`, with post-settle compile green and verified editor closeout. |
| Current-source guarded interaction proof | Development-system Unity `2022.3.62f3` and main-consumer Unity `6000.0.58f2`, both in devmode | Package PlayMode tests pass `7/7` on each consumer, including the uGUI-gated guarded-click delivery and refusal tests; each project was restored to its original Git UPM pin afterwards. |
| Current-source full package gate | Clean devmode projects on Unity `2022.3.62f3` and `6000.0.58f2` | Both versions pass EditMode `86/86` and dependency-free PlayMode `5/5`, plus acceptance, refresh, and compile contracts with authoritative post-settle compile green and verified editor closeout. |
| Reference-driven UI acceptance | Unity `2021.3` and `6000.0` EditMode over `XUUnity.MCP.SelfTest` | `77/78` pass on both editors with one graphics-device-dependent test correctly self-skipping; the graphics-enabled `XUUnity.MCP.UiRenderClick` category passes `11/11`; a project without `com.unity.ugui` compiles with zero errors and builds only the core editor assembly. |
| Typed resolver oracle | Current-source Unity `2022.3` + EDM4U callback adapter | Inactive Android and resolver callback failure fail closed; a project-local Maven coordinate passes with callback success, two stable SHA-256 samples, explicit dependency proof, `trust_class=decision_grade`, and a cleared package-operation busy flag. |
| Consumer regression route | Compile preflight + scenario/contract + PlayMode lifecycle + consistency | Unity `6000.0` passes compile preflight `6/6`, acceptance `10/10`, refresh/compile contract, settled-state and lifecycle recovery, healthy final Edit Mode with zero compiler errors/unrecovered abandons, and project-action consistency. |
| Public site checks | `scripts/testing/run_site_ui_checks.sh` | Public site Playwright checks passed for `v0.3.72`: `42/42`. |
| Historical Git UPM release smoke | Clean Unity project pinned to an earlier public tag | Bridge reached healthy `git_pinned` status, Android APK smoke passed, package self-tests passed, and closeout verified process exit. |
| Multi-project compile matrix | Public summary evidence from consumer validation | `9/9` projects, `38/38` compile lanes, `0` failures |
| Git tag visibility | Remote Git refs | Release tag `v0.3.72` is the current Git UPM release target; remote publication requires an authenticated push. |

Cross-platform status:

| Target | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS host tools | `validated on this host` | Shell wrapper, host tests, same-host Unity readiness/status/health probes, and post-change validation route passed. |
| `v0.3.70` compile-warning evidence (historical, not re-measured since) | `host + Unity 2022 + Unity 6000 validated` | Focused host `211/211`, full host `1011/1011` with 14 expected platform skips, site UI `42/42`, and clean Unity `2022.3.62f3` plus `6000.0.58f2` package lanes pass. Each Unity lane passed EditMode `104/104`, PlayMode `5/5`, acceptance `9/9`, compile contract `2/2`, and verified closeout. |
| Linux host tools | `portable by design` | Bash-compatible launchers/templates exist; run a Linux Unity smoke before claiming live proof. |
| Native Windows clients | `templates provided; CI-exercised` | `run.cmd`, `run.ps1`, and Windows client configs exist; the Windows CI leg drives the real `.cmd` launcher through MCP stdio `initialize`/`tools/list`/`tools/call` end to end (`tests/test_mcp_stdio_e2e.py`), incl. a Cyrillic+spaces project path, plus: a real install through the refresh launcher serving MCP from the installed copy and a spawn of the exact command written by `--install-claude-config` (`tests/test_installed_delegate_e2e.py`), the verbatim README PowerShell 5.1 quickstart with a UTF-16 plan file (`tests/test_readme_quickstart_windows_e2e.py`), the file-IPC transport against a live editor-simulator process incl. a two-process torn-read stress (`tests/test_file_ipc_bridge_simulator_e2e.py`), and cp866/cp1252 hostile-codepage legs (`tests/test_ru_console_codepage_e2e.py`); a live Windows host session with a real Unity editor still needs execution proof. |
| Unity 2021.3+ | `default package line` | Checked-in package metadata targets Unity `2021.3`; setup wizard chooses optional Test Framework recommendations per project. |
| Optional Test Framework | `capability-gated` | Core readiness stays healthy when missing; tests report `disabled_missing_dependency`, `disabled_dependency_too_old`, or supported with `upgrade_recommended` when an existing dependency should be reviewed. |
| License-aware batch fallback | `implemented; host validated` | `license-capabilities` reports batchmode support, blocker code, probe log, and recommended lane. `batch-*` commands default to `--batch-fallback-mode auto` and emit lane summary fields. Live installed-editor matrix remains follow-up evidence. |
| Hub-aware GUI admission | `implemented; host-unit validated` | Platform-native process parsing accepts exactly one live Hub-owned licensing client, redacts channel provenance, refuses ambiguity, and guards explicit Unity version mismatch. A live post-change macOS Hub acceptance run remains required for runtime proof. |
| Bounded compact terminal envelope | `implemented; host-unit validated` | Wrapper `--compact-summary` suppresses nested stdout/stderr and emits one JSON envelope capped at 8192 bytes. |
| PlayMode lifecycle terminalization | `implemented; host-unit validated` | A passed suite plus a fresh healthy post-reload Edit Mode state returns `confirmed_success_after_lifecycle_churn` with retry disabled. |

Mode switch helpers:

```bash
bash xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh devmode --project-root /path/to/UnityProject
bash xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh prodmode --project-root /path/to/UnityProject
```

Rules:

- `devmode` points a Unity project at the local package working tree.
- `prodmode` pins the Unity project to the published release tag that matches
  the package version, for example `#v0.3.72`.
- `prodmode` refuses to pin when that release tag is not visible on `origin`.
- both modes remove the package lock entry so Unity re-resolves honestly.

## Install And Smoke Commands

Install host helper:

```bash
bash init_xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh
```

Enable one project:

```bash
bash init_xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --enable-project
```

Readiness check:

```bash
bash xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh ensure-ready \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --open-editor \
  --background-open
```

Package self-test lane:

```bash
templates/smoke/run_package_self_tests.sh \
  --project-root /path/to/UnityProject \
  --mode all
```

Multi-project compile matrix:

```bash
scripts/testing/run_multi_project_batch_compile_matrix.sh \
  --repo-root /path/to/repo-with-unity-projects \
  --parallelism 4
```

## Safety Status

Current safety guarantees:

- editor-only package assembly
- disabled-by-default bridge activation
- no normal player-build footprint by default
- no dynamic Roslyn execution path
- no SignalR or external relay dependency
- local same-host transport model
- capability-gated reflection-sensitive operations
- mutable bridge/request artifacts stay under `Library/XUUnityLightMcp/`

Current limitations:

- OpenUPM publication is still pending
- Linux and native Windows need live host smoke proof before strong support claims
- Game View operations remain reflection-gated and must be capability-probed
- native OS autofocus is intentionally not implemented; runtime background
  execution reduces focus dependence, while liveness evidence remains required
- License-aware batch fallback is host-capability based; unknown probe failures
  keep batch as a diagnostic path instead of pretending GUI fallback is safe
- device/runtime automation is outside the base package
- broad unrestricted editor mutation is intentionally out of scope
